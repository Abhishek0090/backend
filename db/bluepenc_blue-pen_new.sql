These motors are operated using Arduino which takes input \r\nfrom sensors used for detecting various waste materials one at a time. the sensors used in this \r\nproject are inductive proximity sensors for metal detection and moisture sensor for classification \r\nin dry and wet waste category \r\n When consumer puts waste in the AWS, the sensor gives information to Arduino about \r\npresence of waste in sensing region. Arduino then turns on inductive proximity sensor which \r\nidentifies If the waste is made up of metallic material then sends positive or negative input to \r\nArduino. When a metal target enters the magnetic field created by coil, eddy current circulates \r\nwithin the target. This causes load on the sensor which decreases the oscillatorâ€™s amplitude. As \r\nthe target reaches close to the sensor further the oscillatorâ€™s amplitude decreases, this fluctuation \r\nof oscillator is detected in inductive proximity sensors. If the waste is not detected as metallic \r\nthen another sensor is activated which is moisture sensor, used for sensing moisture content in \r\nthe material to classify waste object as dry & wet waste. Sensor measures moisture content in \r\nthe waste, if the moisture content is above a pre-set threshold value set by manufacturer, then \r\nthe waste is declared as wet waste else it is classified as dry waste. After classification of \r\nwaste as dry, wet & metallic, the input is given to Arduino which is giving input to servomotors \r\nwhich are operating simultaneously to send waste in proper bin assigned for it using two flaps. \r\nOne flap will rotate in X-Y plane and other will rotate in Y-Z plane. Each flap eliminates one \r\nbin at a time, two flaps will eventually eliminate two bins and finally object will be properly \r\nsent to preassigned bin for it. Both flaps will rotate simultaneously with certain time delay to \r\navoid collision between both flaps or to prevent waste from going in the wrong bucket. Time \r\ndelay will be pre mentioned in the coding of Arduino, angle of rotation of each flap will also be \r\nnoted in code. All these values will be calculated pre-fabrication, so that we can design compact \r\nand sophisticated machine. After waste is collected in the bin assigned for it, the ultrasonic \r\nsensors is applied in the bins for detection of level of bins. Ultrasonic sensors work by sending \r\nout a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. The transducer of the sensor \r\nacts as a microphone to receive and send the ultrasonic sound. Ultrasonic sensors like many \r\nothers, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo. The sensor determines \r\nthe distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the \r\n22 / 29\r\nultrasonic pulse. If the distance is less than the threshold distance mentioned by programmer, \r\nthe buzzer will ring notifying the operator that bin is full. Fully filled bins are then removed by \r\noperator and then sent to municipal corporations for further processing such as disposal, recycle \r\nor reuse based on the composition and properties of material used for that particular object, then\r\nempty bins are again placed in the AWS.

This does not include your list of references. \r\no	I really mean 3,000 words as a maximum â€“ there is no +10%!  \r\nâ€¢	While you have some leeway to interpret your chosen question as you see fit, make sure your approach engages with core course material. One major aim of the essay is to gauge the extent to which you have internalized key ideas in readings and lectures. So make sure your essay satisfies this. \r\nâ€¢	Theory is especially important.\r\nâ€¢	Write as if your intended reader was a generally intelligent and informed non-expert. Do not assume key ideas; instead explain them clearly from first principles. If they are crucial, be sure to go in sufficient depth.\r\nâ€¢	Follow appropriate referencing and bibliography. In seeking sources, a useful starting point would be the reading lists provided for this course. A logical next step for deepening your knowledge would be the bibliographies of those works.\r\nâ€¢	The use of a wide variety of relevant academic (ie peer-reviewed) sources is expected. \r\nâ€¢	There is no magic â€˜rightâ€™ number of sources, and quality is preferred over quantity.\r\nâ€¢	Clarity of expression is very important. If English is not your first language, make sure to have your paper proofread by a native speaker.  SBM has a writing tutor â€“ Kyla Sankey, who can help. \r\nâ€¢	Essay structure matters. Make sure your introduction indicates your thesis. Have a plan, make it explicit to the reader, and follow it.\r\nâ€¢	Having a well-articulated thesis statement in your introduction will help to structure your argument and provide a roadmap to the reader. If you are not well-practiced in writing thesis statements, I suggest you seek guidance. SBMâ€™s writing tutor will be helpful.

In these cases, you have to use the label for the head of each household, which can be identified by the rows where â€œparentesco1 == 1.0.â€\r\n\r\nSome of the individuals belong to a household with no head of household, you need to discard those data for training\r\n\r\nThe Target values represent poverty levels as follows:\r\n\r\n1 = extreme poverty\r\n\r\n2 = moderate poverty\r\n\r\n3 = vulnerable households\r\n\r\n4 = non vulnerable households\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe explanations a few features are as follows:\r\n\r\nâ€¢           Id: a unique identifier for each individual, this should not be a feature that we use!\r\n\r\nâ€¢           idhogar: a unique identifier for each household. This variable is not a feature, but will be used to group individuals by household as all individuals in a household will have the same identifier.\r\n\r\nâ€¢           parentesco1: indicates if this person is the head of the household.\r\n\r\nâ€¢           Target: the label, which should be equal for all members in a household\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurther details can be found from the link below.\r\n\r\nSource: https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/data', 'Machine Learning', 'Bachelors', '[\"Programming / Coding Assignment\"]', '[\"Python Basics\"]', '2022-05-04 23:59', '1800-2000', 'Poverty.xlsx_$_', '2023-05-09 21:16:59', NULL, NULL, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1),

Normally\r\nthis section will be reasonably short.\r\nYour literature review should build on the introduction to critically analyse what research currently exists about your topic. What is the gap your research will fill? Why is it an important topic? It should not just describe other relevant research but analyse and integrate existing work to help you frame and justify your topic, your research question, or the issue you want to explore, or the hypothesis you want to test. The literature review enables you to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the topic and should make up a significant chunk of your\r\nproposal. It also allows you to explain some of the key concepts and related studies in more depth.\r\nThe methodology section discusses how you wish to answer your research questions and hypotheses if applicable. If doing a qualitative research project, you will be identifying the phenomenon or issue you wish to investigate. You should discuss and justify the different methods you wish to employ for collecting and analysing data. Information about the sample being used and why you feel this is a good sample should also be included. Additional marks are available for examples of research instruments such as a sample questionnaire or set of interview questions, as well as some basic understanding of what analysis techniques may be useful.

The second type\r\nof analysis is qualitative, which is performed on the basis of external factors like company profile, market situation,\r\npolitical and economic factors, textual information in the form of financial new articles, social media and even blogs by\r\neconomic analyst [3].

Using research, identify the primary conflict drivers, key sources of insecurity, key stakeholders and their interests, and the interventions that have occurred or are occurring to keep and/or build peace. Apply the concepts and literature discussed in Weeks 1-6 to discuss the relevance of the security-development nexus in the context of this case study. This is a critical summary and assessment of the dynamics underpinning a particular conflict case study. You should engage with the course material to help you understand your case and clearly articulate your assessment (which is also your argument) of the conflict. Your conflict assessment should include the following:\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Introduce the conflict case study you have selected, and summarize your assessment into a clear and concise argument (you can think of this like a thesis statement â€“ it is a declarative articulation of the central argument being made in your conflict assessment) (e.g. â€˜While whole-of-government approaches have been attempted in in this context, interventions have failed to address one of the primary conflict drivers, thereby excluding a key stakeholder for peacebuilding). Answer the â€œso what?â€ of your assessment (e.g. The ongoing conflict in this context has led to mass migration, disruption of livelihoods, and has exacerbated the economic challenges this region faces. Failure to address this important conflict driver and include this key stakeholder in resolution efforts, risks this conflict becoming intractable).\r\n\r\nConflict Drivers: Identify and briefly explain the causes of conflict and the primary grievances that have led to violence in this context. Who are the key players? What are they disputing? Are external actors involved? Etc.\r\n\r\nSources of Insecurity: How is the conflict impacting civilians? What are the primary results of the violence? (e.g. economic precarity, displacement, sexual and gender based violence, genocide, political marginalization, etc.)\r\n\r\nKey Stakeholders and their Interests: In this section, detail who has interests in the conflict or who may be impacted by how the conflict plays out. This is not the warring parties (as these should be discussed in the Conflict Drivers section), but is rather about what other actors may impact or be impacted by how the conflict plays out in your case study context. These may include international actors, transnational forces, corporations, non-state groups, political parties,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nInterventions: Overview the types of peace-related interventions that have taken place in your case study. Have those interventions been successful or faced serious challenges? Have those interventions employed efforts at policy coherence by combining or harmonizing security and development? Based on your assessment of the conflict dynamics, what is missing from the interventions that have been tried or are being tried?', 'Social Science', 'Bachelors', '[\"Essay Writing\"]', '[\"Social Science\"]', '2022-11-01 12:00', '3000', 'Midterm Assignment - Conflict Assessment.pdf_$_', '2023-05-09 21:16:59', NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0),

Your report should demonstrate wide reading and comprehension of the theoretical frameworks introduced in the module. You are expected to draw on key concepts and frameworks to analyse the process of launching new ventures. Good reports will draw on theoretical concepts to show understanding of the challenges typically encountered when creating a new venture. This may include frameworks explaining the influence of uncertainty and related knowledge problems on new ventures; strategies for creating new firms, the foundersâ€™ role, and how entrepreneurs can overcome challenges such as resource dependency and liabilities of newness/scale.\r\n\r\nPart 2: A Self-reflection (30%)  Written in the first person (I) this part of the report should demonstrate your personal understanding of the process of creating a new venture. You do not need to draw on theoretical frameworks in Part 2. Instead, you can draw on previous entrepreneurial experiences (e.g., founding your own firm, working for start-ups, entrepreneurial competitions (e.g., Ingenuity) internships, family business etc). It may also be helpful to draw on your experiences during this module. For example, what insights did you gain from designing a Business Model for a new venture? What might you do differently? Finally, you may project into the future to consider how you would approach the process of launching a new venture. Have you gained any insights from this module that you would use in the future if you were creating your own venture or joining a start-up?\r\n\r\nSome key points to consider:\r\n\r\n1)   The individual report requires two parts: Part 1 is a standard academic essay with references, introduction, discussion, and conclusion.

Employers put a high value on candidates who can demonstrate skills in critical thinking, synthesising (bringing together) material from different sources, and analysing complex material.\r\nYou should choose any ONE of the fictitious companies shown below as the focal company for your Company Briefing Paper.\r\nCompany A: Get Fit Now is a new pay-as-you go gym, targeting consumers who have become disillusioned by high joining and membership fees of health clubs. As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place.\r\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience. The products are positioned as fun, stylish, â€œmust-\r\n\r\nhaveâ€ items aimed at encouraging young girls (12-17 years old) to get into a regular hair care routine.\r\nCompany C: Nice Ice is a chain of ice cream cafes targeted at teenagers and their parents. Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\r\nCompany D: Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable.

Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another â€“ thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth.

The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\r\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\r\nÂ§ How did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\r\nÂ§ What did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\r\nÂ§ How might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\r\nThe reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as\r\na separate document.\r\n\r\nFor more read file attached below', 'Bba', 'Bachelors', '[\"Report Writing\",\"Research Paper\"]', '[\"Marketing Communication\"]', '2023-02-12 03:01', '4000', 'Marketing communication final assignment.pdf_$_', '2023-05-09 21:16:59', NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0),

Employers place high importance on communication and listening skills, and the Experts and Novices sessions will enable you to practice and hone your talents in both areas.  \r\n\r\nIn preparation for the workshops you are required to find and read at least four academic journal papers on your chosen literature review topic and prepare a written summary of your findings in the form of a Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). \r\n\r\nThe Critical Thinking module on Canvas provides resources to help you produce your TAG, and enrolment on the module is recommended:  https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/7439\r\n\r\nGiven the co-created nature of these sessions, their success depends entirely on everyone taking responsibility for their part in the sessions and the impact of this on others. This means actively participating in the workshops and coming prepared, i.e. having done the reading and produced the required TAG preparation paper. Specifically:\r\n\r\nExperts must find and read at least four academic journal articles* in their chosen topic area and prepare a written summary of these articles in the form of a fully-referenced Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). In your designated Expert workshop session, you will use your TAG paper as the basis for your explanation about your topic to a small group of Novices.\r\nExperts must also find examples of how brands/companies have used/ applied the theory in practice, to illustrate your findings to your Novices.\r\nNovices must read the relevant content in Fill & Turnbull (2019) or at least ONE academic journal article in order to gain a basic understanding of the topic AND find examples to discuss in class. Be ready to ask questions of your Expert.\r\nDuring the roundtable sessions, after the Experts have shared their findings with the Novices, Experts and Novices will work together to apply the theory to a practical scenario and produce recommendations for practice.\r\nAt the end of every roundtable both Experts and Novices are required to complete a Contribution Sheet that reflects on your input into the sessions and what you got out of them. You must submit a satisfactory Contribution Sheet in order to gain your marks for each workshop roundtable.\r\n \r\n', 'BBA', 'Bachelors', '[\"Report Writing\"]', '[\"Marketing Communication\"]', '2023-03-30 09:00', '4000', 'Measuring ambush marketing and sponsorship effects a football consumer response approach.pdf_$_Less Sponsorship As Advertising and More Sponsorship Linked Marketing As Authentic Engagement.pdf_$_Sponsorship-linked_marketing_ (1).pdf_$_Sponsorship-linked_marketing_.pdf_$_Tax sheet for Adarsh.docx_$_', '2023-05-09 21:16:59', NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);

For the sake of clarity, unlike on some modules there is no percentage allowance for excess words: the limit is 2000 words exactly. (For the sake of clarity, unlike on some modules there is no percentage allowance for excess words: the limit is 2000 words exactly.)\r\nThis does not include reference lists and bibliographies although citations in the main body of your assignment do count. The words in the question itself, which will be your title, do not count against the word limit.\r\nDo not include a summary at the beginning of the essay, as well as your introduction: that would count against the word limit, and you would risk a deduction of marks for repetition.\r\nDo not use appendices: they would also count against the word limit and in any case the evidence supporting your argument should be in the main body of your essay.\r\nGuidance on the coursework assignments\r\n1. To answer any of the coursework questions, you will need to draw upon your learning from the seminars. You should expect to use examples which you examined in preparatory study for and in discussion during the seminars for this module.\r\n2. Use and compare two or three case studies to illustrate and support your arguments. You can draw cases from the articles and books suggested in the reading lists, in particular from the reading lists for the seminar tasks. Supplement the information on these cases by searching using the QMUL library, to find additional peer reviewed articles and also look for major investigative reports.\r\n3. Donâ€™t just describe. Focus your answer on causal processes which explain the outcomes for risk management which you want to argue in, in response to the specific question set.\r\n4. Ensure that your answer draws on material covered week 1-8 of the module.\r\nCoursework questions\r\nSelect one of the following three questions and write an essay of not more than 2000 words in answer to it.\r\n1. Enterprise risk management: Assess the evidence for and the limitations of the main arguments made by at least three advocates and by at least three critics of enterprise risk management (ERM). In particular, assess the evidence for their rival claims about its\r\n\r\npracticality in implementation, effectiveness and capacity to limit the effect of bias, for different kinds of businesses and organisations, for different kinds of risks, and for different phases of the business cycle.\r\nSupport your analysis of the strengths and weakness of the advocatesâ€™ and the criticsâ€™ cases by comparing either cases of attempts to implement ERM either in (a) two contrasting industries or (b) in two firms of very different sizes.\r\n2. Risk perception / communication: Under what conditions and with what risk communication strategies, if any, can companies succeed in reassuring consumers who are sceptical of the safety of a companyâ€™s products or services and local residents living or working near a companyâ€™s hazardous site or plant or operations?\r\nSupport your analysis by comparing evidence about conditions for success and strategies from two industries, one of which should be concerned with risk communication to consumers about product or service safety and the other with risk communication to local residents about operational safety. Both cases should concern routine business work, not crisis or post-crisis conditions. Identify key differences and similarities between these contexts.\r\n3. Project risk in mega-projects: Why does the implementation of project risk management procedures so often fail to reduce project risks in mega-projects? Review empirical evidence from research and assess the relative importance of at least four different factors.\r\nSupport your analysis by comparing cases of more and less successful mega-projects, where risk management procedures were implemented in each case, even in the less successful project.\r\nGeneral advice\r\n- Answer the exact question set.\r\n- Structure your essay carefully, with a clear introduction that â€˜signpostsâ€™ the sequence of the argument to be made out, a main body of argument, and a conclusion which integrates the whole argument.\r\n- Support your answer with carefully marshalled, ordered and sequenced presentations of empirical evidence, setting out your reasons for answer to the question in full.\r\n- Use empirical cases and evidence to illustrate your argument.\r\n- Use the literature in the field critically.\r\n- Define and explain key concepts when you introduce them.\r\nCommon mistakes to avoid\r\n1. Being vague â€“ e.g., failing to define key terms, writing obscurely, failing to be clear and unambiguous.\r\n2. Over-claiming â€“ claiming too much, claiming more than your evidence really supports.\r\n3. Asserting rather than arguing â€“ failing to support your claims with empirical evidence\r\nand logically related reasons.\r\n4. Swithering â€“ arguing for one answer to the question set in one part of the essay and\r\nthen arguing for a quite different or even opposite answer in another part of the essay.\r\n5. Being indecisive â€“ writing a â€˜on the one hand ... and on the other ...â€™ answer to the\r\nquestion set that does not come down clearly in favour of one answer to it.\r\n6. Not considering the limitations of at least one opposing case, if only briefly.\r\n\r\n7. Presenting a conclusion that does not follow from the argument or the evidence.\r\n8. Trying to rely on knowledge drawn from other modules.\r\n9. Writing without a well-thought out structure â€“ e.g., no evident and logical sequence of\r\npoints that build up to a step-by-step argument to a conclusion.\r\n10. Being uncritical and not being thoughtful â€“ e.g., taking the conventional â€˜textbookâ€™\r\nwisdom for granted, without interrogating it, without examining whether the evidence\r\nsupports it.\r\n11. Summarising â€“ just summarising what leading authors have written, without making an\r\nargument of your own.\r\n12. Writing about the topic rather than answering the exact question set.\r\n13. Being too simple â€“ e.g., assuming practice will mechanically follow rules set in laws or\r\nobjectives of programmes, taking simple abstract and theoretical differences between\r\nindustries for granted, over-generalising about fields.\r\n14. Presenting your essay poorly â€“ e.g., writing illegibly, not making your paragraph breaks clear and\r\nobvious, not numbering and indenting key points in those cases where this would be helpful to the reader in understanding some steps in your argument.\r\nFormat\r\nâ–ª All work must be typed and submitted in MS Word or Adobe PDF format\r\nâ–ª Font size should be 12 point (unless otherwise specified)\r\nâ–ª Font style should be Arial\r\nâ–ª Lines should be double-spaced\r\nâ–ª Leave margins for comment Insert page numbers\r\nâ–ª Use a header containing your student ID number, the module code to which your work\r\napplies, and the date\r\nâ–ª Always spell-check and proof read your work before handing it in (once you have\r\nsubmitted your work you will not be permitted to retrieve it)\r\nâ–ª Keep your own electronic back-up copy of your work and if possible save on two\r\ndevices\r\nâ–ª Avoid plagiarism\r\nâ–ª Submit your work on time\r\nLate submissions\r\n1. Coursework submitted late (and there are no extenuating circumstances) will incur a late penalty. Five per cent of the total marks available shall be deducted for every period of 24 hours, or part thereof, that an assignment is overdue there shall be a deduction of five per cent of the total marks available (i.e. five marks for an assessment marked out of 100). After seven calendar days (168 hours or more late) the mark shall be reduced to zero, and recorded as 0FL (zero, fail, late).\r\n2. Each module has word limits for coursework assignments; however, the decision about whether to impose a penalty mark for exceeding the word limit is made by each module organiser. You must check the module handbook and the assignment briefing documents to see whether the particular module organiser has adopted a penalty system. It is your responsibility to read the handbook and assignment briefing carefully. If no penalty is specified then the module organiser will take into account the word length under the standard marking conventions. For example, if you have exceeded the word limit then it might be that you have not been sufficiently succinct or focused in your assignment and therefore might be penalised for these weaknesses. Please note that word limits do NOT\r\n\r\n3. 4.\r\n5.\r\n6. 7.\r\n8.\r\ninclude references or appendices. However if excessive material is included on appendices then this too will be judged accordingly and you may be awarded a lower mark.\r\nYou should ensure that your submission is in either Microsoft Word or PDF format. Failure to submit in either one of these formats will result in a mark of 0 being awarded for the particular assessment. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the file format is correct and it can be opened by the receiving party.\r\nYou should ensure that the correct piece of assignment is uploaded as the document downloaded on the due date by the module organiser will be marked regardless of content. You will not have another opportunity to submit the work again if you mistakenly uploaded the wrong document.\r\nALLOW YOURSELF PLENTY OF TIME TO SUBMIT YOUR COURSEWORK. DO NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE\r\nComputer problems, such as computer viruses, failure to make a back-up copy or temporary internet access problems, will NOT be viewed as a valid reason for late submission.\r\nCheck that your assignment submission has been successful, and print a copy of the confirmation screen.\r\nIf you\r\nvia QMplus however you will be penalised for late submission, the only exception to this is if you have an approved extension due to extenuating circumstances.\r\nsubmit your assignment after the deadline, you will still be able to submit your coursework\r\nSubmission deadline\r\nDate\r\nTime\r\nQMplus Link/Page\r\nEstimated 29th March 2023\r\nEstimated 1600pm\r\nTbc â€“ Assessment information tab in BUSM117 QMPlus page\r\n\r\n                Marking criteria for both the coursework assignment and the examination\r\nThe marking criteria for the coursework assignment and for the examination are the same. They are set out in the following table, which you will also see used to provide feedback on your assignment and to explain the mark given. For both the coursework assignment and for the examination, you must ONLY use the literature listed in the reading lists in this module handbook for all conceptual and theoretical points. For your case studies, however, you may use other peer-reviewed sources or other reputable, well-researched sources.

You will write up an up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area, as well as some recommendations to a fictitious company (to be chosen from a list of four) on how this company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their \r\nfuture marketing communications.\r\n\r\nThe individual assignment comprises of three elements:\r\n\r\n1. A fully-referenced Company Briefing Paper (2,000 words maximum)\r\n\r\n2. A reflective statement on the research process (200 words maximum)\r\n\r\n3. Preparation for and contribution to five â€œExperts and Novicesâ€ roundtables, including a TAG (Thematic Analysis Grid). \r\n\r\n The task\r\n\r\nElement 1 â€“ Company Briefing Paper\r\n\r\nYou should choose one of the topics below as the subject of 2,000 words (maximum) fully-referenced Company Briefing Paper. Your chosen topic designates you as an â€œExpertâ€ at the relevant Roundtable Experts & Novices workshop sessions (see Element 3 below).\r\n\r\nPlease note that a limited number of places will be available for each topic, therefore you should choose a secondary topic as a back-up. A topic sign-up list will be available on Canvas closer to the time.\r\n\r\nÂ· Brand placement\r\n\r\nÂ· Sponsorship\r\n\r\nÂ· Ethics in Marketing Communications\r\n\r\nÂ· Customer Journey Communications\r\n\r\nÂ· Interactive/Digital & mobile communications\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper must be written in the 3rd person and provide the Marketing Director of a fictitious company (see below for choice of companies) with the following:\r\n\r\nAn up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area\r\ndrawing on an absolute minimum of two carefully selected academic journal \r\narticles and on a range of at least ten diverse sources. \r\nIntegrate into your discussion at least two examples of how the academic theory reviewed is used/ applied by brands/ companies in current practice. Here, you should draw on practitioner sources such as the trade press (e.g. Marketing Week), newspaper articles (e.g. The Guardian) and news sources (e.g. BBC), and blogs, articles and websites written by credible industry commentators and experts. \r\nRecommendations for how the fictitious company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their future marketing communications.\r\nIn this way, your Company Briefing Paper will pull together the academic literature on a topic with examples drawn from marketing practice. Employers put a high value on candidates who can demonstrate skills in critical thinking, synthesising (bringing together) material from different sources, and analysing complex material.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should choose any ONE of the fictitious companies shown below as the focal company for your Company Briefing Paper. \r\n\r\nCompany A: Get Fit Now is a new pay-as-you go gym, targeting consumers who have become disillusioned by high joining and membership fees of health clubs. As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place. \r\n\r\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience. The products are positioned as fun, stylish, â€œmust-haveâ€ items aimed at encouraging young girls (12-17 years old) to get into a regular hair care routine.\r\n\r\nCompany C: Nice Ice is a chain of ice cream cafes targeted at teenagers and their parents. Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\r\n\r\nCompany D: Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable. It is targeted at consumers who need to replace their phone whilst reducing their impact on the environment. The companyâ€™s marketing objective is to seize a 10% market share in the mobile phone market in year 1 by building awareness and trial rapidly.\r\n\r\nKey elements of a Company Briefing Paper\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is an indicative list only of what should be included in your work, it is not a running order or list of contents: thus, the logic and flow of material is up to you to decide.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to the paper (what is the purpose of the paper and what it will cover?)\r\nCritical analysis and discussion of academic theory in your chosen topic area. You should aim to focus your discussion on any issue that you consider to be of relevance/ importance/ interest â€“ but â€“ be careful to scope it in. Do not be tempted to cover too many issues. Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another â€“ thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth. For example, is there an area of controversy or divided opinion in the subject area, e.g. where researchers have found different or conflicting results?\r\nExamples â€“ integrate practitioner sources to demonstrate how the issues raised in your review of the academic literature are used /applied in the case of at least two companies/ organisations/ brands in their marketing communications\r\nConclusions and recommendations: what conclusion do you draw from the review of the academic literature? Based on this, what recommendations would you make to the Marketing Director of your chosen fictitious company?\r\nReferences: ALL sources used in the work must be shown in accurate Harvard style, including the in-text citations and the Reference list at the end of the work.\r\nAppendices are optional and should be used only if there is a need to include any supporting information.\r\nPresentation style â€“ your paper must be presented to professional standards and demonstrate a coherent structure. It should include a title page, contents page, page numbers, and a clear system of appropriate headings and sub-headings.\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 2 â€“ Reflective statement on the research process\r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper requires you to find, evaluate and use information drawn from a range of academic and practitioner sources. The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\r\n\r\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\r\n\r\nHow did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\r\nWhat did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\r\nHow might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\r\n The reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as a separate document.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 3 â€“Experts and Novices Roundtable Sessions\r\n\r\nFive Roundtable Experts & Novices sessions in Teaching Block 2 take the form of expert and student-led, co-created workshops, where students take on the role of either an â€œExpertâ€ or a â€œNoviceâ€ and work together to share and develop knowledge about the topics for the Company Briefing Paper.\r\n\r\nFollowing from Element 1 above, your chosen literature review topic designates you as an â€œExpertâ€ at the relevant roundtable session. For the roundtable sessions where the topic is not your chosen literature review topic, you are a â€œNoviceâ€. Everyone will therefore be an â€œExpertâ€ at one session and a â€œNoviceâ€ at the other four sessions.\r\n\r\nAttendance at the Roundtable Expert and Novices workshop sessions is mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshops is to develop subject knowledge and help you prepare for the assignment. You will also develop your research skills as well as gain confidence in your ability to explain the results of your research to others. Employers place high importance on communication and listening skills, and the Experts and Novices sessions will enable you to practice and hone your talents in both areas. \r\n\r\nIn preparation for the workshops you are required to find and read at least four academic journal papers on your chosen literature review topic and prepare a written summary of your findings in the form of a Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). \r\n\r\nThe Critical Thinking module on Canvas provides resources to help you produce your TAG, and enrolment on the module is recommended: https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/7439\r\n\r\nGiven the co-created nature of these sessions, their success depends entirely on everyone taking responsibility for their part in the sessions and the impact of this on others. This means actively participating in the workshops and coming prepared, i.e. having done the reading and produced the required TAG preparation paper.

In your designated Expert workshop session, you will use your TAG paper as the basis for your explanation about your topic to a small group of Novices.\r\nExperts must also find examples of how brands/companies have used/ applied the theory in practice, to illustrate your findings to your Novices.\r\nNovices must read the relevant content in Fill & Turnbull (2019) or at least ONE academic journal article in order to gain a basic understanding of the topic AND find examples to discuss in class. Be ready to ask questions of your Expert.\r\nDuring the roundtable sessions, after the Experts have shared their findings with the Novices, Experts and Novices will work together to apply the theory to a practical scenario and produce recommendations for practice.\r\nAt the end of every roundtable both Experts and Novices are required to complete a Contribution Sheet that reflects on your input into the sessions and what you got out of them.

(980, 1066, 'Commerce', 'How consumers cope with the challenge of identity loss or change due to life transitions such as retirement, divorce, or migration and how this influences their consumption of nostalgic products and experiences in the future. ', 'You can use the social-self theory to explore how consumers seek to maintain or restore their sense of belonging and identity through consumption.\r\n\r\nUsing self-identity theory, identify and evaluate a contemporary societal challenge that is influencing the consumption behaviour of consumers. Develop conclusions from your evaluation. Use these conclusions to develop a â€˜future imaginationâ€™ of how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\r\nYour evaluation must include a critical appraisal of self-identity theory to inform your arguments. Additionally you must include evidence of relevant changing consumption behaviours and predictions from relevant experts. You must develop your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ from your conclusions. \r\nIn addressing the above question, you are advised to make the following choices:\r\n1)	Choose a specific consumer segment who engage in a specific consumption behaviour occurring in response to a societal challenge. You can phrase this as a problem or opportunity. \r\n2)	Focus on one consumer segment pertinent to your topic and country/sector choice. You should develop a profile of this segment, providing as much pertinent information as you can, e.g. using sociodemographics, psychographics. Please present visually or in table format, fully referenced.\r\n3)	Focus on one country for your essay. Having this focus will make it a lot easier for you to identify and evaluate the evidence within the word limit specified.\r\n4)	While you are required to use self-identity theory for your essay, you MUST focus on a specific concept, model or framework within it. For example, the self-concept model, social-self, pro-environmental self-identity, pro-social self-identity, body image, etc. Choose ONE of these. Do NOT include multiple identity frameworks/ models in your essay because this will undermine the depth of analysis you can achieve within the 3000 word count limit.\r\nOnce you make the above choices, you are required to investigate research evidence from academic articles, news from legitimate sources, industry reports etc. to critically analyse how consumer behaviour has changed in response to the societal issue you have identified. Building from this appraisal, you will explain, evaluate and apply your identity framework/model to your chosen issue. This will enable you to develop evidence-based analytical conclusions, from which you can create your future imagination.\r\n\r\nYou should draw on a good range of high quality academic and expert opinion sources to construct solid arguments for your paper. You should use relevant examples and data to support your claims. Ensure you fully reference all sources of information.\r\nYou are required to write a critique of transforming/transformed consumer behaviour, informed by contextual information, evidence and relevant theory. Your critique will involve you assessing varied data, ideas and scholarship from varied sources. Be adventurous in your searching but note the advice given to you on reputable sources. \r\nYou must focus on one framework/model of identity theory in your essay. This will really help you to develop a stronger critical appraisal to show your understanding and critical thinking. \r\nYou must choose only one country and one consumer segment. Within this country and segment, try to analyse your chosen CB transformation broadly and briefly. Then narrow down again to your chosen sector/industry/segment and again articulate this transformation. You now have an explanation that is country, sector and consumer specific. Now that you have this foundation, you can begin to build your academic arguments by integrating your chosen identity theory. Continuously, apply and evaluate your theory to your country/sector/segment otherwise your context and theory risk being disconnected. Lastly, extrapolate your conclusions to a 5-10 year future in order to imagine how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. \r\nYou must ensure the evidence you use to compile your paper relates to your choices (i.e. do not use American evidence to discuss China!). Preliminary reading will help you to make your choices. Whatever you choose to do, ensure you present your argument for your choices at the start of your paper â€“ and justify them. \r\nAssemble the evidence for your arguments, avoid unsubstantiated statements and bias - this is an objective investigation. It is essential that you critique your chosen theory and evidence, do not just describe it; evaluate the contribution it makes to our understanding of transforming/transformed consumer behaviour and how marketing to consumers (as customers or event participants) will evolve as a result in the future.\r\n\r\nGUIDELINES:\r\nPart 1: Introduction and Explanation (500-800 words): Introduce and examine your societal challenge, consumer segment and behaviour and country. Explain the issue clearly and its impact, citing supporting evidence and justify why it is worthy of exploration in your essay. Include a profile of your chosen consumer segment.\r\nPart 2: Evaluation and application of theoretical framework (1500-1800 words): Begin by giving an overview of identity theory, then focus on your chosen identity framework/model. Explain it and apply it to you challenge and context in part 1. Evaluate its contribution in explaining the CB transformation that is occurring, using scholarly research and evidence to support your arguments. Use examples throughout, pertinent to your focus. Images and illustrations can be used and add value to written arguments. \r\nPart 3: Conclusions (300-500 words): Develop conclusions based on your content in parts 1 and 2. Do not simply summarise your essay (this is not a conclusion). Your conclusions should be insightful and analytical and lead into your future appraisal. They should also demonstrate your learning from critically reviewing your chosen context and identity theory. Developing a â€˜visual mapâ€™ to illustrate this can be a useful communication tool; this is entirely up to you. Examples are discussed in the assignment briefings and clinics. Keep your writing style concise and focused. Numbering each conclusion will be helpful for cross referencing with your future appraisal. You could also consider these as a map for part 4.\r\nPart 4: The future (<500 words): This is where you get to be creative! Tell us, based on your analysis in part 1,2 and 3 your core ideas for imagining how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. Include specific examples of your chosen issue/segment/behaviour. You can present your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ as text and visually (we are not expecting artwork from you). Visualisation is encouraged and can include multiple formats, e.g. drawing, photographs, and digital images. Infographics are useful, using free software that is readily available. Check permissions for using any images that are not your own (and reference them as instructed by the owners).   \r\nMake sure your discussion of the future is connected and builds upon what you have stated in the body of your essay and is backed by evidence.\r\nPlease note: \r\nParts 1 and 2 need to be fully and extensively referenced. \r\nPart 3 will contain some pertinent references to support your insight e.g. from futurism, but should not repeat the full range of references in your theory review. Remember conclusions represent your critical thinking built from your prior analysis which you have already referenced. \r\nPart 4 does not require references, albeit you may need to reference some futurism insights if you include them here instead of in your conclusion (either place is fine). This section is showcasing your critical and creative thinking.\r\nThe use of subheadings to break up the essay is OK, however, please ensure you donâ€™t have too many as you risk hyper-fragmenting your essay, which may hamper the flow of discussion and subsequent analysis.\r\n', 'Msc. marketing', 'Masters', '[\"Essay Writing\"]', '[\"Consumer behaviour\"]', '2023-05-05 01:00', '5000', 'MARK7013 HB S2 2022-23.docx_$_', '2023-05-09 21:16:59', NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),

Develop conclusions from your evaluation. Use these conclusions to develop a â€˜future imaginationâ€™ of how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\r\nYour evaluation must include a critical appraisal of self-identity theory to inform your arguments. Additionally you must include evidence of relevant changing consumption behaviours and predictions from relevant experts. You must develop your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ from your conclusions.\r\nIn addressing the above question, you are advised to make the following choices:\r\n1) Choose a specific consumer segment who engage in a specific consumption behaviour occurring in response to a societal challenge. You can phrase this as a problem or opportunity. Here are some suggestions to help you to develop your own ideas. You do not need to choose from any of them. You can chose any combination that addresses the assignment question. Please ask your tutor if you are unsure:\r\nï€­ Climate change and sustainable development, e.g. eco-tourists and climate change, millennials and consumption reduction, activists and anti-consumption.\r\n Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\nï€­ The increasing interest in health and fitness is another potential area, including shifts that have occurred from the Covid-19 pandemic. Examples include a shift from in-person to online fitness classes. Growth in wearable health technology. Increasing membership of online health and wellbeing platforms.\r\nï€­ Advances and benefits of artificial intelligence in consumption choices. Examples include using an AI chatbot for a health care consultation. AI in agriculture (intelligent farming) to increase food availability/nutrition to mitigate food poverty and migration. AI designed to inform consumerâ€™s decision-making (e.g. online shopping â€“ getting purchasing right first time to prevent waste). Developing positive body image chatbots to promote a healthy body image among younger consumers.\r\nï€­ Shifts in dietary choices. For example, in response to food/water insecurity, biodiversity, and animal welfare considerations, as well as advances in food science and technology. This has supported shifts to â€˜different lifestylesâ€™ and created opportunities for food innovation development and lifestyles including vegan, flexitarian, anti-meat, artificial food e.g. lab-made â€˜meatâ€™.\r\nï€­ Economic constraints are also triggering CB changes, e.g. frugal consumption connected with growing poverty, consuming from â€˜foodbanksâ€™ and â€˜community fridgesâ€™. Sharing/leasing not buying, pre- owned/recycled/ repurposed are also an outcome of this, as well for ecological reasons (positive or negative depending on perspectives).\r\n2) Focusononeconsumersegmentpertinenttoyourtopicandcountry/sector choice. You should develop a profile of this segment, providing as much pertinent information as you can, e.g. using sociodemographics, psychographics. Please present visually or in table format, fully referenced.\r\n3) Focus on one country for your essay. Having this focus will make it a lot easier for you to identify and evaluate the evidence within the word limit specified.\r\n4) Whileyouarerequiredtouseself-identitytheoryforyouressay,youMUST focus on a specific concept, model or framework within it. For example, the self-concept model, social-self, pro-environmental self-identity, pro-social self- identity, body image, etc. Choose ONE of these. Do NOT include multiple identity frameworks/ models in your essay because this will undermine the depth of analysis you can achieve within the 3000 word count limit.\r\nOnce you make the above choices, you are required to investigate research evidence from academic articles, news from legitimate sources, industry reports etc. to critically analyse how consumer behaviour has changed in response to the societal issue you have identified. Building from this appraisal, you will explain,\r\n18\r\n Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\n\r\nevaluate and apply your identity framework/model to your chosen issue. This will enable you to develop evidence-based analytical conclusions, from which you can create your future imagination.\r\nGuidelines\r\nYou should draw on a good range of high quality academic and expert opinion sources to construct solid arguments for your paper. You should use relevant examples and data to support your claims. Ensure you fully reference all sources of information.\r\nYou are required to write a critique of transforming/transformed consumer behaviour, informed by contextual information, evidence and relevant theory. Your critique will involve you assessing varied data, ideas and scholarship from varied sources. Be adventurous in your searching but note the advice given to you on reputable sources.\r\nYou must focus on one framework/model of identity theory in your essay. This will really help you to develop a stronger critical appraisal to show your understanding and critical thinking.\r\nYou must choose only one country and one consumer segment. Within this country and segment, try to analyse your chosen CB transformation broadly and briefly. Then narrow down again to your chosen sector/industry/segment and again articulate this transformation. You now have an explanation that is country, sector and consumer specific. Now that you have this foundation, you can begin to build your academic arguments by integrating your chosen identity theory. Continuously, apply and evaluate your theory to your country/sector/segment otherwise your context and theory risk being disconnected. Lastly, extrapolate your conclusions to a 5-10 year future in order to imagine how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\r\nYou must ensure the evidence you use to compile your paper relates to your choices (i.e. do not use American evidence to discuss China!). Preliminary reading will help you to make your choices. Whatever you choose to do, ensure you present your argument for your choices at the start of your paper â€“ and justify them.\r\nAssemble the evidence for your arguments, avoid unsubstantiated statements and bias - this is an objective investigation. It is essential that you critique your chosen theory and evidence, do not just describe it; evaluate the contribution it makes to our understanding of transforming/transformed consumer behaviour and how marketing\r\n19\r\n Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\n\r\nto consumers (as customers or event participants) will evolve as a result in the future.\r\nNot sure what to choose? Maybe this article will help: Rust, Roland T. (2020). The future of Marketing, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 37(1), 15-26.\r\nTo help develop your ideas and your â€˜future imaginationâ€™, refer to the academic articles published in â€œFuturesâ€ in the suggested readings at the end of this assignment briefing. This is a starting point, please source others relevant to your chosen topic.\r\nTo see an example of an imaginative future go to Dermody, J., Koenig-Lewis, N., Zhao, A. L., & Hanmer-Lloyd, S. (2021). Critiquing a Utopian Idea of Sustainable Consumption: A Post-Capitalism Perspective. Journal of Macromarketing, 41(4), 626â€“645. https://doi.org/10.1177/0276146720979148\r\nFurther readings will be added to Moodle, as appropriate. Please also refer to the readings attached to each topic, as these may also be relevant for your essay.\r\nPresenting coursework for assessment\r\nYour assignment when submitted should not include your name â€“ we use a system of anonymous marking to reduce the risk of any unconscious bias. For some authentic assessments, there may be an exception to this, so please confirm with your Module Leader.\r\nWe suggest the following format for your essay, which mimics the marking criteria listed in the table below, Please discuss with your seminar leader if you wish to depart from this structure:\r\nPart 1: Introduction and Explanation (500-800 words): Introduce and examine your societal challenge, consumer segment and behaviour and country. Explain the issue clearly and its impact, citing supporting evidence and justify why it is worthy of exploration in your essay. Include a profile of your chosen consumer segment.\r\nPart 2: Evaluation and application of theoretical framework (1500-1800 words): Begin by giving an overview of identity theory, then focus on your chosen identity framework/model. Explain it and apply it to you challenge and context in part 1. Evaluate its contribution in explaining the CB transformation that is occurring, using scholarly research and evidence to support your arguments. Use examples throughout, pertinent to your focus. Images and illustrations can be used and add value to written arguments.\r\n20\r\n  Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\n\r\nPart 3: Conclusions (300-500 words): Develop conclusions based on your content in parts 1 and 2. Do not simply summarise your essay (this is not a conclusion). Your conclusions should be insightful and analytical and lead into your future appraisal. They should also demonstrate your learning from critically reviewing your chosen context and identity theory. Developing a â€˜visual mapâ€™ to illustrate this can be a useful communication tool; this is entirely up to you. Examples are discussed in the assignment briefings and clinics. Keep your writing style concise and focused. Numbering each conclusion will be helpful for cross referencing with your future appraisal. You could also consider these as a map for part 4.\r\nPart 4: The future (<500 words): This is where you get to be creative! Tell us, based on your analysis in part 1,2 and 3 your core ideas for imagining how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. Include specific examples of your chosen issue/segment/behaviour. You can present your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ as text and visually (we are not expecting artwork from you). Visualisation is encouraged and can include multiple formats, e.g. drawing, photographs, and digital images. Infographics are useful, using free software that is readily available. Check permissions for using any images that are not your own (and reference them as instructed by the owners).\r\nMake sure your discussion of the future is connected and builds upon what you have stated in the body of your essay and is backed by evidence.\r\nPlease note:\r\nParts 1 and 2 need to be fully and extensively referenced.\r\nPart 3 will contain some pertinent references to support your insight e.g. from futurism, but should not repeat the full range of references in your theory review. Remember conclusions represent your critical thinking built from your prior analysis which you have already referenced.\r\nPart 4 does not require references, albeit you may need to reference some futurism insights if you include them here instead of in your conclusion (either place is fine). This section is showcasing your critical and creative thinking.\r\nThe use of subheadings to break up the essay is OK, however, please ensure you donâ€™t have too many as you risk hyper-fragmenting your essay, which may hamper the flow of discussion and subsequent analysis.\r\n\r\nmy topic- over dependence on technology in the USA on GenZ', 'International Business Management ', 'Masters', '[\"Essay Writing\"]', '[\"Consumer Behavior\"]', '2023-04-27 13:00', '3000', 'MARK7013 HB S2 2022-23 - Tagged.pdf_$_19228910_UCB_MARK7013.pdf_$_', '2023-05-09 21:16:59', NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),

The aim of this assessment is to enable you to develop and demonstrate your ability to: (a) diagnose a problem in business and management, (b) arrive at the consequent research questions, (c) determine how to answer these questions by drawing on the academic literature, (d) assess the potential of different research methods and (e) plan a small-scale research project.  \r\nYour report is intended to form the plan for how you might use the literature (by drawing on the ideas and findings of others), design a research project and analyse the findings.  \r\nThis report is among the most challenging assignments set during the M.Sc. programmes. You are being asked to anticipate the issues that will confront you in conducting a small research project. Thus, it is quite different from and more difficult than, writing a conventional coursework paper. The best reports are usually those produced by those students who have devoted considerable thought to the assignment before even beginning to write the report.  \r\nYour choice of problem for the project proposal report does not commit you to that topic for your dissertation. You can just complete the report as a free-standing exercise in which you are assessed on your ability to analyse a problem, grasp the arguments and the evidence contained in the literature and devise a suitable research design. You are free to select a different topic for your dissertation if you so wish, although there are obvious advantages in sticking to a topic to which you have already given thought and invested some work (although you must avoid cutting and-pasting parts of the proposal into the dissertation).  \r\n', 'Msc Management', 'Masters', '[\"Dissertation Writing\"]', '[\"Research Methodology\"]', '2023-04-30 22:00', '4000-5000', 'Link to all the reading material for the research proposal.docx_$_', '2023-05-09 21:16:59', NULL, NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),
