My \r\n\r\nclient buys the fabric from a third party and give it to manufacturers who have \r\n\r\nbeen informed by us about the design required and then after the garments \r\n\r\nare manufactured and sold to retailers. The client is facing problems with the \r\n\r\nthe inventory of garments. The client has lost many transactions over the years as \r\n\r\nwell as the name of the retailers he sold them to all over the country which makes it difficult to contact those retailers for potential business opportunities. As the client is in the wholesaling business, he deals with quantities in the high hundreds and sometimes even thousands for a particular garment, and as the client has no digital framework to keep track of these garments it makes it difficult to know as to how much of a particular colour or a sample of a garment is remaining. The client also cannot keep track of whether or not only the designated person has entered the details in the book containing inventory and garments. And does not know if any details have been falsified. The client also has trouble recording the attendance of his employees, the clientâ€™s employees are only entitled to 8 days of holidays apart from festive seasons and they are subject to lose their salary if they exceed the 8-day limit.\r\n\r\nRationale â€“ The major \r\n\r\nproblems Mr. Rajendra and his company was facing was the attendance \r\n\r\nrecord of his employees and the amount of garments that were sold in which \r\n\r\nsize and colour. I have decided to make a software that will enable him to keep track of all these things such as customer names, garments sold, colour of garment sold and the size. The software will also include a feature where Mr. Rajendra can mark the attendance of an employee. \r\n\r\nTo create the following project, I will utilise NetBeans (Java OOP). Java \r\nprogrammes are interoperable with any operating system, making them easy to run on my client\'s computer. NetBeans will let me import both built-in and third-party libraries, which will speed up the development process. Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are all ideas that Java will allow me to use which will further enhance the software. Java also includes a number of features that will allow me to integrate my product with other software, such as the MySQL Database Management System (DBMS). Because it is a free application that runs on every OS and is exceptionally compatible with NetBeans, this is the best database administration software.\r\n\r\n', 'Computer science ', 'Diploma', '[\"Programming / Coding Assignment\"]', '[\"Computer Science IB board\"]', '2022-02-27 00:00', '20000 rs ', 'Criterion A.docx.pdf_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '8', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

(192, 192, 'Engineering', 'Final year project(Automatic Waste Segregation)', 'The process starts with customer or user placing waste object in a slot provided in the front \r\nface of the machine and then waste object is sensed with help of sensors and categorized using \r\nflaps which rotate using servomotor. These motors are operated using Arduino which takes input \r\nfrom sensors used for detecting various waste materials one at a time. the sensors used in this \r\nproject are inductive proximity sensors for metal detection and moisture sensor for classification \r\nin dry and wet waste category \r\n When consumer puts waste in the AWS, the sensor gives information to Arduino about \r\npresence of waste in sensing region. Arduino then turns on inductive proximity sensor which \r\nidentifies If the waste is made up of metallic material then sends positive or negative input to \r\nArduino. When a metal target enters the magnetic field created by coil, eddy current circulates \r\nwithin the target. This causes load on the sensor which decreases the oscillatorâ€™s amplitude. As \r\nthe target reaches close to the sensor further the oscillatorâ€™s amplitude decreases, this fluctuation \r\nof oscillator is detected in inductive proximity sensors. If the waste is not detected as metallic \r\nthen another sensor is activated which is moisture sensor, used for sensing moisture content in \r\nthe material to classify waste object as dry & wet waste. Sensor measures moisture content in \r\nthe waste, if the moisture content is above a pre-set threshold value set by manufacturer, then \r\nthe waste is declared as wet waste else it is classified as dry waste. After classification of \r\nwaste as dry, wet & metallic, the input is given to Arduino which is giving input to servomotors \r\nwhich are operating simultaneously to send waste in proper bin assigned for it using two flaps. \r\nOne flap will rotate in X-Y plane and other will rotate in Y-Z plane. Each flap eliminates one \r\nbin at a time, two flaps will eventually eliminate two bins and finally object will be properly \r\nsent to preassigned bin for it. Both flaps will rotate simultaneously with certain time delay to \r\navoid collision between both flaps or to prevent waste from going in the wrong bucket. Time \r\ndelay will be pre mentioned in the coding of Arduino, angle of rotation of each flap will also be \r\nnoted in code. All these values will be calculated pre-fabrication, so that we can design compact \r\nand sophisticated machine. After waste is collected in the bin assigned for it, the ultrasonic \r\nsensors is applied in the bins for detection of level of bins. Ultrasonic sensors work by sending \r\nout a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. The transducer of the sensor \r\nacts as a microphone to receive and send the ultrasonic sound. Ultrasonic sensors like many \r\nothers, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo. The sensor determines \r\nthe distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the \r\n22 / 29\r\nultrasonic pulse. If the distance is less than the threshold distance mentioned by programmer, \r\nthe buzzer will ring notifying the operator that bin is full. Fully filled bins are then removed by \r\noperator and then sent to municipal corporations for further processing such as disposal, recycle \r\nor reuse based on the composition and properties of material used for that particular object, then\r\nempty bins are again placed in the AWS.

This does not include your list of references. \r\no	I really mean 3,000 words as a maximum â€“ there is no +10%!  \r\nâ€¢	While you have some leeway to interpret your chosen question as you see fit, make sure your approach engages with core course material. One major aim of the essay is to gauge the extent to which you have internalized key ideas in readings and lectures. So make sure your essay satisfies this. \r\nâ€¢	Theory is especially important.\r\nâ€¢	Write as if your intended reader was a generally intelligent and informed non-expert. Do not assume key ideas; instead explain them clearly from first principles. If they are crucial, be sure to go in sufficient depth.\r\nâ€¢	Follow appropriate referencing and bibliography. In seeking sources, a useful starting point would be the reading lists provided for this course. A logical next step for deepening your knowledge would be the bibliographies of those works.\r\nâ€¢	The use of a wide variety of relevant academic (ie peer-reviewed) sources is expected. \r\nâ€¢	There is no magic â€˜rightâ€™ number of sources, and quality is preferred over quantity.\r\nâ€¢	Clarity of expression is very important. If English is not your first language, make sure to have your paper proofread by a native speaker.  SBM has a writing tutor â€“ Kyla Sankey, who can help. \r\nâ€¢	Essay structure matters. Make sure your introduction indicates your thesis. Have a plan, make it explicit to the reader, and follow it.\r\nâ€¢	Having a well-articulated thesis statement in your introduction will help to structure your argument and provide a roadmap to the reader. If you are not well-practiced in writing thesis statements, I suggest you seek guidance. SBMâ€™s writing tutor will be helpful. Online sources might also help, such as\r\no	https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/thesis-statements/\r\no	https://www.servicescape.com/blog/25-thesis-statement-examples-that-will-make-writing-a-breeze', 'International Business ', 'Masters', '[\"Essay Writing\"]', '[\"Business (AS & A level)\"]', '2022-04-20 19:00', '2000', 'Essay Instructions and Marking Criteria.docx_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

PLEASE WRITE ONLY SUBSTANTIVE STUFF IN THE MOST PROFESSIONAL MANNER.\r\nThis assignment is part of my dissertation so I\'d request your best writer to indulge in it.\r\n\r\nBroad topic: Parents\' involvement in their children\'s sports participation.\r\nResearch question: What are Indian parents\' perceptions of their adolescent athletes\' career trajectory in elite sports? \r\nBasically, what my dissertation will focus on: the psychosocial influences that operate within parents which ultimately contribute to their child\'s career outcome in sports.\r\n\r\nResearch has suggested that parents, rather than teachers/coaches/instructors, are the most influential social factors in childrensâ€™ sports involvement.  \r\nResearch over the years has proved that Sports have much more to offer than what we are currently utilizing. Sports help in building the character and personality of a person, besides being an excellent medium for instilling values like discipline, respect, team spirit, decision making, and keeping depression at bay among many others.\r\nThough it has been established that sport has so many benefits, very few Indian parents involve their kids in sports participation.\r\nAmongst the lot that does as well, there are very few parents who encourage their children to take up a sport as a career (after high school- transitional into college).\r\nWE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES THE PARENTS TAKE THIS DECISION APART FROM THE SOCIAL FACTORS (eg. finances, a sport not being considered a career, low govt funding, sport politics, caste etc)\r\nWE WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE INDIAN SUBCULTURE AFFECTS PARENTS DECISION MAKING ON HOW THEY SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN OR NOT SUPPORT (the psychosocial reasons)\r\nWe will understand this via a theoretical model of parental involvement in sport- Teques & Serpa\'s model which was based on Hoover- Dempsey and Sandler\'s model. You will need to link the theory and parental influences- MOST IMP. \r\nI am attaching four papers that I have read. I will request that you use more papers that are mentioned in their references. Papers by Chris Hardwood are a huge plus point if used.\r\n\r\nOverall, India has a good amount of talented kids playing sports at the sub-elite level. Having said that, this does not show up in high-level tournaments like the Olympics. India has the worst per head medal tally at the Olympics. We want to see how parents play a role in this as they are the most influential models in children\'s sports involvement. Through the lit review, and eventually the paper, I want to try and figure out the parental side of things and how they support their child from moving into elite level sport, that is, choosing a career in sport. And how my study can help understand parents cope with stress and how we can minimize the dropout rates of potentially the next generation of sports athletes and eventually better the medal tally at big tournaments like the Olympics.\r\n', 'Sport psychology', 'Masters', '[\"Literature Review\"]', '[\"Sports, exercise and health science\"]', '2022-04-19 22:00', '1500-2000', 'Parents About Parenting Dual Career Athletes- A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_$_Parental involvement in sport- Psychometric development and empirical test of a theoretical model.pdf_$_Indian sport- Problems and prospects.pdf_$_Elite & Sub-Elite Youth Athletes.pdf_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This will be one of three broad types:\r\nA.	A primary research based empirical study; \r\nFor this type of project your starting point will typically be from a gap or problem that arises from academic theory.  Your rationale will identify the gap or problem in the theory; your intended audience is likely to be academic and the conclusions will have a more academic and theoretical focus.  \r\nB.	A desk-based project to include a literature review along with further analysis of secondary data;\r\nThis will require you to have access to a suitable existing data set but will not involve the collection of primary data.\r\nC.	An organisation-based research project.\r\nThis type of project has a more practical focus similar to a consultancy type of research.  The research could be for an organisation that you have approached, or could be for the organisation that you work for.  In the past some students have used their research project to undertake research as a foundation for a business enterprise or venture that they are planning.  Your rationale will identify the practical issue or problem which needs addressing and your introduction will provide the context to your organisation. Your intended audience will be practitioners and the conclusions will focus on practical recommendations rather than theoretical developments.  \r\nWhichever form is selected the Research Project report must include a critical review of relevant literature and a critical appraisal of the methodology selected.  \r\nYou will be advised on the most suitable type of project for your topic area during the research methods module and in the initial discussions with your supervisor.\r\n	The structure and style of the project submitted should be appropriate to its intended outcomes. Outlined below are the key stages of tackling a large project.  Your work should include these stages but, depending on the topic of study and the research design, the emphasis between them may vary. \r\nBefore looking at each of the stages in more detail it is vital not to deal with too wide a subject. The more closely the investigation can be defined the better will be the chance of achieving the learning outcomes (and a good mark).  \r\nYou should also note that you are expected to analyse and explain issues associated with the phenomenon being studied, rather than merely describing them. \r\nNormally, the project is written in an impersonal style (ie not using the first person, â€˜Iâ€™). However, where you use certain methodologies it may be permissible to refer to yourself in the first person.\r\n	Aim and Objectives \r\n	State the aim and objectives of your study i.e. what is the purpose of the project. \r\n	State your objectives in such a way that you can measure the extent to which they have been achieved. You may have a proposal (hypothesis) that is capable of being tested or you may have identified a research problem to investigate or a research question to answer. \r\n	Also it is very important to ensure that the aim and objectives defined are achievable within the scope of the research project (timescale, data availability and number of words).\r\n	Introduction and Approach\r\n	The introduction sets the context for the study. This covers the rationale behind the choice of topic and the overall approach to the work and how it is structured.  In other words it includes the justification for your aim and objectives and an overview of how you go about achieving them.  Decide what information is needed to achieve the aim and objectives and how you are going to collect it. Do not include areas that are not related to the topic. \r\n	Review of Theory and Literature Survey\r\n	This stage requires an investigation and discussion of past and current research/literature on your topic. To do this you should read and summarise relevant information on the topic. This literature review must be used to develop a theoretical framework for your work. It will vary according to the type of study that you are undertaking. However, an apparent lack of literature probably means that the topic is unsuitable for a research project. \r\n	The role of the literature survey can be summarised as follows:\r\nâ€¢	To help further clarify the purpose of your research and contribute to a rationale for the work.\r\nâ€¢	Provide a thorough examination of the relevant literature, so giving you a full understanding of the topic.\r\nâ€¢	Clearly identify and define the theoretical concepts and/or frameworks to be used in the work.\r\nâ€¢	To provide a context for your research by placing your specific topic in the literature and showing how your work relates to that already existing.\r\nâ€¢	Identify and analyse the relationships between ideas that make up the framework for your study.\r\nâ€¢	Provide a basis for your methodological choices\r\n\r\nIn order to do this it is necessary to look for and summarise areas of agreement and disagreement and contradictory evidence and analyse and evaluate theory and evidence with reference to the objectives of your study. \r\nA literature review should be comprehensive, current, critical and clearly focused on your objectives. It should cover the full range of literature available that relates to your topic. It is a requirement of a literature review that you use academic and research literature from journals, books, papers and government publications. Online research databases such as â€˜Discoverâ€™ provided by the library will enable you to search a wide variety of sources relatively easily.\r\nFollow the guidelines on referencing for the Leeds Beckett Harvard system. Also, wherever possible, you should refer to work read rather than overuse direct quotations (ask your supervisor if you are still unsure about the difference between direct and indirect quoting or paraphrasing). Also see the section on referencing below.\r\nAt this stage of the process your objectives will probably undergo some refinement or your research problem/question(s) will become more precise.\r\nOne of the key challenges of the research project is to produce a coherent and holistic piece of work in which all the sections link together and are clearly focused on the aim and objectives. This is obviously important throughout but especially so in establishing the relationship between the literature review and any primary research or secondary data analysis undertaken.\r\nThis should be discussed in detail with your supervisor but the basic principles are that:\r\nâ€¢	Your literature review is concluded effectively and you are clear about the findings and how they relate to the aims and objectives.\r\nâ€¢	The findings of your literature review are clearly and explicitly used to inform the methodology and, hence, the primary research.\r\nâ€¢	The data sought from the primary research is properly identified and is derived from and related to the literature review findings. \r\nâ€¢	The methods used to carry out the research are appropriate and relevant to the findings of the literature review and the data sought. \r\n\r\nResearch Design and Methodology\r\nIt is important to develop an effective methodology and to understand why your methodology is appropriate to this particular study. Consideration should therefore be given to the best methods to use to address the research problem or question that you have identified.\r\nYour method will vary with the type of study, but you will probably need to collect or locate data and analyse them.  This may well involve you in primary research (collecting data for the specific purposes of your project).  It does not, however, have to take this form. It may be possible to use existing data in a way that is new to this study.\r\nIt is expected that you will deal with the following elements in this stage of the research project:\r\nâ€¢	The specific purpose of this part of the process and how it contributes to the overall aims and objectives of the work.\r\nâ€¢	The choice of research approach (primary/secondary â€“ qualitative/quantitative).\r\nâ€¢	The choice of sample â€“ size, characteristics and selection method.\r\nâ€¢	If using primary data the methods used to collect the data and the precise design of any instruments used (interview schedules, questionnaires, observation checklists etc.).\r\nâ€¢	If using secondary data a critique of the collection method and awareness of any limitations\r\nâ€¢	Techniques used to analyse the data (again qualitative or quantitative).\r\nâ€¢	Critical evaluation of each of these factors.\r\nThe research methods module will have introduced a variety of data gathering techniques and associated means of analysis.  It is important that you are able to honestly criticise the methodology you have used, in the light of the outcomes and your original objectives. For example, how reliable and/or valid are the results? Are the measurements accurate? Is there any bias? etc. No research is perfect and the ability to reflect on your own research practice is an important part of becoming a good researcher.\r\n\r\nWHATEVER METHOD YOU ADOPT, YOU MUST NOT APPROACH ANY OUTSIDE BODY OR SEND OUT ANY POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRES UNLESS THE ETHICS COORDINATOR AND YOUR SUPERVISOR HAVE GIVEN PERMISSION AND YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL THE NECESSARY ETHICS FORMS (AVAILABLE VIA Leeds Beckett Ethics Online). \r\nThis requirement applies equally to interviews with members of the public (such as street interviews) as to any other form of data gathering. These individuals may be contacted by tutors, as a means of verifying the data you attribute to them.  If potential participants wish to retain anonymity, you must explain to them that their identity will only be shared with tutors.\r\nPrimary Research Requirements\r\nPast experience has shown that the majority of students elect to undertake some form of primary research. This helps to support/test the findings of their reading and to draw effective and realistic conclusions for their work. \r\nWhen carrying out research it is vital that you conduct it professionally and ethically. \r\nVerification: In the past we have had some students who have been unable to verify the source(s) of their data or the way in which it was collected. As a result of this you MUST meet the requirements outlined below. \r\nAlthough this detail may not be presented in your research project due to issues of confidentiality and anonymity you must make sure that you keep records of the following in line with the Universityâ€™s research ethics policy. \r\n\r\n1.	Records of all sources of data.\r\n2.	Identify your sources including as much of the following information as possible;\r\nâ€¢	Name and addresses of individuals contacted.\r\nâ€¢	Their position within the organisation.\r\nâ€¢	The address of the organisation head office\r\nâ€¢	Dates & times of contacts.\r\n3.	Signed consent forms\r\n4.	The use of questionnaires carried out on a random basis in the street is usually discouraged in the project. Your supervisor is likely to ask you to look for alternative methods if you are considering this as an approach. If you do use this approach you must still collect as much of the data as possible from each respondent.\r\n\r\nIt is the intention of staff involved in the research project to follow up a random sample of primary research to confirm the information presented is accurate.\r\nEthics: the Universityâ€™s policy on research ethics is quite clear. All research should conform to some basic principles:\r\n1.	Beneficence â€“ â€˜do positive goodâ€™ and\r\n2.	Non-maleficence â€“ â€˜do no harmâ€™\r\n	The research should be assessed for potential risks concerning participants â€“ the interests of subjects and participants in the research should always come before those of the research itself.\r\n3.	Informed consent of participants\r\n	All participants should be given full and accurate information in order for them to decide whether to take part in the research or not. Example of Information sheet can be found on MyBeckett. \r\n4.	Confidentiality & anonymity\r\n	Explicit consent must be gained from participants in order to publish any information that may enable them to be identified. Examples of Consent forms can be found on MyBeckett. \r\n	(if the research involves a questionnaire then the consent form can be built into this, rather than requiring  a separate consent form)\r\nPlease refer to the separate guidance on â€œEthical clearance for research undertaken by studentsâ€ and submit the appropriate forms online as indicated via your MyBeckett module. \r\nClick here to submit your research ethics forms online https://researchethics.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/auth?redirect=%2F \r\nETHICS FORMS MUST BE SUBMITTED AND APPROVED BEFORE ANY PRIMARY RESEARCH IS UNDERTAKEN. WE RECOMMEND THIS IS DONE AT LEAST EIGHT WEEKS BEFORE YOUR SUBMISSION DATE.\r\nAny student without final ethics approval performing primary research or submitting work that includes primary research will be subject to investigation for unfair practice under the University Academic Regulations Section 10: Academic Integrity.\r\nBefore you begin your research; whether using primary sources (human subjects such as consumers, event managers, company employees etc.) or secondary sources (TripAdvisor comments, newspapers or company websites etc.) you must complete your Research Ethics forms online, have your Research Ethics forms approved by your supervisor and then approved by the Local Research Ethics Coordinator\r\nPlease read the Leeds Beckett University Research Policy https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/-/media/files/policies/research-and-enterprise/upre_research_ethics_policy.pdf\r\nData Presentation, Analysis and Discussion\r\nPresent the data professionally, logically and clearly. There are two different methods suggested for this; either present your main findings separate from any analysis or discussion, or present your findings and discussion together. \r\nAs a general guideline it is likely that the former will be more appropriate for quantitative data and the latter for qualitative data. This is a guide not a rule you must follow, there will always be instances when either approach is appropriate. Make sure you discuss this with your supervisor.\r\nThe form of data analysis undertaken will vary according to how the project has been approached. Thus some research projects may involve highly quantitative analysis whereas others may utilise qualitative methods.  The research methods programme will introduce you to various data analysis techniques.  \r\nThe analysis needs to be appropriate for the study. For example, simple descriptive analysis may be acceptable in some instances but more sophisticated inferential analysis may be more appropriate and improve the quality of your findings. However you need to plan this in advance as collection of the wrong or insufficient data will make it difficult or impossible to conduct the required level of analysis. \r\nDiscussion of the significance of your results should consider:\r\nâ€¢	comparisons with similar research and findings in the literature;\r\nâ€¢	to what extent the data confirms or detracts from any theoretical framework developed in the literature review and/or used in your research;\r\nâ€¢	whether your data collection methods may have affected the results;\r\nâ€¢	practical and theoretical implications for firms, management, government bodies etc.\r\nThis section gives you the opportunity to evaluate your findings in context and thereby demonstrate your skills of evaluation, analysis and synthesis.\r\nConclusions and Recommendations\r\nConclusions (and possibly recommendations) are the final part of your work. They should follow naturally from the work done to this point and should summarise the key issues emerging from your work and set it in a wider context.  Is it possible, for example, to generalise on the basis of your findings? You conclusion should do this without bringing in any new arguments. Keep it concise and focused on the implications of your findings. \r\nDepending on the nature of the subject matter, you may wish to offer recommendations. These may be for the industry in terms of future action or for researchers considering a similar topic. \r\nIt is appropriate for you to suggest other, related, avenues for further consideration. This is not an afterthought to be tacked on to the end of the research project; it is a key element of the work that should not be left to the last minute. \r\nReferences \r\nAll sources of information to which you refer must be cited using the Harvard referencing convention. You should already be fully conversant with this style; if not full guidelines are available in the library or on the intranet.  \r\nThe reference list should not be a general list of publications on the topic. Only include those references to which you refer in the text, do not include sources read but not directly referred to.\r\nLast word\r\nThe better projects do not merely follow a linear process and are not a â€˜diaryâ€™ of what you did. The finished written work represents a completed solution to (or recommendations for) an identified problem. This means that you will revisit all sections of the written work throughout the module possibly revising your aim and objectives at the end of the process. With this in mind do not use the future tense but write as though you have completed the work. Past or present tense is appropriate.\r\n4.2.2	Further Assessment Details\r\nAssessment for the research project is based on the final completed thesis.\r\nYou will have had guidance about how to write your proposal for the Project within Research Methods. \r\nOnce proposals have been submitted they will usually be reviewed by the Course Research Project Co-ordinator and any appropriate colleagues for context specific elements. After reviewing your proposal you will be allocated a supervisor.\r\nYou must make arrangements to discuss with them immediately to start the research process. Where the proposal has not been passed you may be required to make changes before you start on your research. \r\nThe proposed title may change during the course of the work as might the methods employed or even the specific objectives. \r\nChanging topics part way through will severely limit the time available and you are unlikely to achieve the necessary standard of work.  Any request for alteration of the topic must be channelled through your Supervisor to the Course Research Project Co-ordinator.\r\nAssessment of the research project will be based on the criteria listed later in this section.  Each project will be double marked (supervisor plus one other member of staff) and the final mark may be the subject of scrutiny by the external examiner. \r\nThere may also be a confirmatory viva voce (interview) if necessary.\r\n\r\n4.2.3	Guidance on formatting your Masters Research Project\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Typing should be one and a half line-spaced, except for extended quotations, which should be single-spaced and indented. \r\nâ€¢	The left-hand margin should be a minimum of 40mm, and the remaining margins should be at least 20mm. \r\nâ€¢	The font should be 12 point except for headings and titles. \r\nâ€¢	Typing can be double sided.  \r\nâ€¢	All pages should be numbered.\r\n\r\nAt the front of the project there should be:\r\na)	a title page giving: \r\nï±	the title of the research project, which should give a clear indication of the content\r\nï±	your name\r\nï±	the name of your course, for example  â€œMSc International Events Management\" \r\nï±	the words â€œLeeds Beckett Universityâ€\r\nï±	the month and year of submission\r\n\r\n\r\nExample: 					   Title\r\nName\r\nPresented as part of the requirement for the award of the\r\nMSc/MA in â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.\r\nLeeds Beckett University\r\nMonth, Year\r\n\r\na)	a declaration page with the wording:\r\nI, â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” confirm that the work contained in this research project is my own work. It has not been previously published or submitted for assessment elsewhere.\r\nI confirm that all other sources of information have been acknowledged in line with the regulations for referencing.\r\nI confirm that I have fully complied with all University regulations regarding plagiarism and unfair practice.\r\nI confirm that the word count for the dissertation is XXXX\r\nName:    \r\nSignature:    ____________________ Date: ____________\r\n\r\nb)	an acknowledgements/dedications page (if desired).\r\nc)	an abstract of approximately 250 words outlining the main arguments\r\nd)	a contents page listing the page numbers of all sections/chapters \r\nand including , if appropriate\r\n-	a list of tables \r\n-	a list of figures, including maps, diagrams, photographs, etc.\r\ne)	a list of appendices (to include evidence of ethical approval).\r\n\r\nThe nature of the content will inevitably vary depending upon the individual study.  However, each project should normally include:\r\nï±	a background to the issue, explaining why it is important;\r\nï±	a clear statement of the research problem;\r\nï±	a review of relevant literature;\r\nï±	details of the methodology used;\r\nï±	the findings;\r\nï±	analysis and interpretation;\r\nï±	conclusions and recommendations or implications (possibly for theory, practice, policy, further research)\r\nï±	A bibliography of references (in Harvard style and only those you have referred to in the text.)\r\n\r\n	Numbering of pages begins with the Introduction to the report itself and not with the Title page, Acknowledgements and Contents. These pages are known as â€œPrelimsâ€ and if numbered should be given a different numbering from the main text e.g. (i) (ii) (iii) etc.  (The title page should not be numbered.) Numbering should be at the bottom centre of each page.\r\nThe length of the research project should be a maximum of 14,000 words (excluding appendices). The word count starts at your introduction and finishes after your recommendations\r\n\r\n	It is considered part of the discipline of the Research Project to work within this word limit.  Please pay attention to the maximum word-length for your assignment. You will not be penalised if you go slightly over the limit (up to 10%) but learning to write concisely is part of the discipline of producing a good, focussed essay or report. If your assignment is over-long we will not mark it and your work will be recorded as a non-submission.  Appendices should be used sparingly, essential information should be included within the word count as content in the appendices is not assessed.  The word limit excludes the list of references, appendices and assignment cover sheets.â€\r\n\r\nThe criteria for assessing the project are identified in Appendix B.  Your research project will, therefore, be assessed on the extent to which it demonstrates:\r\nâ€¢	The clarity of the rationale and focus. The level of internal consistency and the logical development of information to sustain arguments linking the research rationale, literature and findings indicating a high level of critical awareness of strengths and limitations of the research. Clarity of analysis and evaluation;\r\nâ€¢	A comprehensive literature research and/or study of background information consistent with the stated aim of the research project;\r\nâ€¢	An advanced understanding of the conceptual and theoretical perspectives and appreciation of methodological issues related to the research topic and has constructively criticised all major viewpoints illustrating awareness of strengths and limitations;\r\nâ€¢	That the analysis and/or discussion of the collected data or information is logically sound and is relevant to an evaluation of any hypothesis offered and the degree to which the aims have been fulfilled;\r\nâ€¢	That the presentation of the research project is in the approved manner with reference to format, argument, statistical information and analysis, appendices and referencing;\r\nâ€¢	The project is demonstrably the student\'s own work.\r\n\r\nKeeping in contact with your supervisor provides you with an opportunity to ensure that you are approaching your project in a manner that will increase your likelihood of meeting the assessment criteria.\r\n\r\nStudent Instructions for Submission of Coursework \r\nThis module requires you to submit your work online.\r\nYou MUST submit your work through MyBeckett using the link set up by the tutor. Receipt of your work will be recorded.\r\nYour \"Turnitin assignments\" in MyBeckett can be set up so that you can check your assignment yourself as you submit it. This checking is done by creating a \"Similarity Report\".  If this report shows that there are some problems with your work, such as un-cited quotations, you should be able to make corrections and re-submit the work again before the due date. More information about Turnitin is available online here: http://libguides.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/mybeckett/turnitin\r\n\r\nPlease note: Tutors will follow up any suspected breach of academic integrity found after the submission date as per University policy. Late penalties will apply as per University Regulations.\r\n\r\nParticular Instructions to Students\r\nPlease read carefully the assessment and grade/marking descriptors overleaf:\r\n \r\nCourse Title(s): 	MSc International Events Management / MSc Sports Events Management / MSc Responsible Tourism Management / MSc Experiential Event Marketing\r\nModule Title:	Masters Research Project	Level:	7\r\nAssessment Title:	Masters Research Project	Weighting: 	100%\r\n\r\nCriteria and Weighting	100-70\r\nExcellent	69-60 \r\nGood	59-50\r\nSatisfactory	49-40\r\nPoor	39-0\r\nFail\r\nRationale, aims and objectives\r\n\r\n	Excellently articulated and evidenced rationale, background & context.\r\nA novel and legitimate aim with appropriate objectives detailing what will be achieved	Rationale, background & context very clear and evidenced through reference to a range of sources.\r\nA clear aim and appropriate objectives 	Rationale, background & context clear and evidenced through reference to a range of sources.\r\nAim detailed with achievable objectives	Rationale, background & context included but lacking clarity/purpose.

(368, 368, 'Arts', 'Essay ', 'As a reminder, here are the requirements for your second essay:\r\n\r\n\"The remainder of the term will be devoted to a longer researched essay, running five-to-eight pages in length.â€¯Students should use no fewer than eight (8) sources, two of which should be from peer-reviewed publications \r\n\r\nAs before, students should be encouraged to propose their own topics and devise original projects tailored to their future disciplines and/or current interests.\" \r\n\r\nBefore submitting your final draft, do the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Edit the draft for wordiness. Take a critical look at each sentence and trim out as many words as you can without losing the meaning. Wordy sentences contain many unnecessary words. These sentences feel â€œwatered downâ€â€”like you have to do a lot of work to gain a little information.\r\n\r\nGood writing is dense and concise; the words in the sentence work hard. Consider the following revisions:\r\n\r\nWordy: A few inches of snow on the ground is all that is necessary in order for a person to be able to go sledding.\r\n\r\nBetter: A few inches of snow is necessary to go sledding.\r\n\r\nWordy: All of the students who are new to this school are required to attend a meeting that has been scheduled for Friday the 22nd of September.\r\n\r\nBetter: New students are required to attend a meeting on Friday, September 22. \r\n\r\nNote: The problem with wordiness is not about the quantity of words; there is nothing wrong with a sentence having 25 or even 75 words as long as those words add information and detail. When reducing wordiness, be careful not to kill the richness and expressiveness of your writing.\r\n\r\nNot wordy: A bird with crimson wings glided from the jungle canopy and landed gracefully on a nearby rock.\r\n\r\nNot better: A bird flew from the trees to a rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Edit the draft for vague language. Look critically at your word choices and ask: Can I think of a more specific word for this?\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine you\'ve written a sentence like this: \"In society, we often create interpersonal relationships with people who resonate with our values.\" Underlined are words that could definitely be more specific. Does the author mean society or 21st century America? Does he mean interpersonal relationships or friendships or love affairs or workplace collaborations? \r\n\r\nIf you can\'t get more specific, that\'s okay. But make sure you\'re using words like humans for a reason. Here are some usual suspects when it comes to vague language: They, Those, People, A Person, Individuals, Humans, Adults, Society, We, Us, One, Someone, Everybody, Anyone, Human Beings, Civilians, Citizens, Many, Early, Most, Others, Things, Stuff, Certain, Aspects, etc.\r\n\r\n3. See if you can do something about your overuse of the verb \"to be\" (is, am, was, etc.)\r\n\r\nI have a tendency to write with an abundance of these verbs:\r\n\r\nIt was morning when Jolene stepped into the forest. The sunlight and thick branches were above her, and wildflowers were by the trunks of the trees. There were many critters on the dirt road. This place was Joleneâ€™s favorite spot whenever she wanted time alone.\r\n\r\nBut through revision (with an emphasis on strong verbs) you can vary the language:\r\n\r\nAt morning, Jolene stepped into the forest. Sunlight shone down on thick branches, and wildflowers grew near the trunks of the trees. Critters scampered along the dirt road. Whenever Jolene wanted time alone, she came here.\r\n\r\n4. Do a search in your document for \"ly.\" This will help you track down most of your adverbs: \"quickly,\" \"urgently,\" \"desperately,\" etc. Typically eliminating adverbs and making your verbs stronger can help you reduce wordiness, vary language, and do all that other good stuff.\r\n\r\nBefore: \"He ran quickly.\"\r\n\r\nAfter: \"He bolted.\"\r\n\r\nSee? One word instead of two -- without losing meaning. Also \"bolted\" is a lot more specific and less mundane: excitement in writing.\r\n\r\n5. Add more in the way of analysis. After each quotation, you are meant to (1) make some original contribution and (2) connect the quotation\'s claim to your topic sentence.  \r\n\r\nLook to the passages of text that follow any quotation. Ask yourself critically: Have I said anything new here? Or am I merely repeating the ideas in the quotation? Try discussing what the author has neglected to consider in his/her/their quotation. Think up ways to take the argument further. Discuss unforeseen consequences and/or benefits. \r\n\r\nIf you attempted to \"get done\" with your analysis in one quick sentence, that won\'t do.

There are three\r\nmain components to a research proposal:\r\nIn this section, you will be expected to explain the importance and implications of your chosen research topic. For example, if you are studying the impact of brands on consumer choice then you should discuss why brands are an important area of study and how you feel your research can improve our knowledge of the topic. Normally\r\nthis section will be reasonably short.\r\nYour literature review should build on the introduction to critically analyse what research currently exists about your topic. What is the gap your research will fill? Why is it an important topic? It should not just describe other relevant research but analyse and integrate existing work to help you frame and justify your topic, your research question, or the issue you want to explore, or the hypothesis you want to test. The literature review enables you to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the topic and should make up a significant chunk of your\r\nproposal. It also allows you to explain some of the key concepts and related studies in more depth.\r\nThe methodology section discusses how you wish to answer your research questions and hypotheses if applicable. If doing a qualitative research project, you will be identifying the phenomenon or issue you wish to investigate. You should discuss and justify the different methods you wish to employ for collecting and analysing data. Information about the sample being used and why you feel this is a good sample should also be included. Additional marks are available for examples of research instruments such as a sample questionnaire or set of interview questions, as well as some basic understanding of what analysis techniques may be useful. The key to this section is an appreciation for how you wish to go about your research and why you feel this is the best\r\napproach.\r\nNB! We do not expect you to collect any primary data as part of the research proposal!

There is no one right or definitive answer to a case question. However, a student should not conclude that there are no wrong answers. Case responses differ because of differing identification of issues and analysis of relations among issues, differing determinations of what the root or underlying issues are, and differing development of recommendations to resolve the root issues and, in turn, the other issues. Although a variety of responses are valid at every stage, some, clearly, are incorrect. The case response format is not fixed; typically it depends on the case question. However, using a simple, standardized form will improve case responses and provide a context for unambiguous marking. It is recommended that students use the issue analyses-recommendations framework, deciding for themselves, according to the particular case, whether to use the three headings or to combine the first and second or the second and third. The three parts are described and analyzed below.\r\nIssues\r\nProblems or issues are those attributes, factors, and/or activities that are wrong with the organization.\r\nStudents should read a case question once or twice to gather its essence. While reading, it is helpful to identify the issues by circling or highlighting them or by taking notes. Then, the student reviews these identified issues, adding to them any issues revealed by related analysis of financial statements and other supplementary information supplied.\r\nIn order to \"size up\" the root issues, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the organization and its issues. This analysis can be accomplished in two steps. First, make a list of the issues. Arrange and assemble similar issues into groups. Explain the relationships among the groups or categories that emerge at this stage. The groupings should be governed by two criteria.\r\nFirst, same or related issues should be grouped together; for example, all issues related to inaccurate financial information would go into one group. Second, associations among issues within a group should be specified; for example, inaccurate accounting information led to poor decisions on inventory orders.\r\nSecond, the relationship among the categories must be explained. This explanation should reveal the root issues. Once they are disclosed, the root issues should be linked in a logical sequence. This listing should show the dependent relationship between the other issues and their root issues. Care should be taken to account for any specific requests that arise because of the role assigned to the student. The request may specify the perspective the student takes in assessing the issues. Requests may also be understood as additional issues.\r\n\r\n The primary reason for grouping and ranking issues is to detect the underlying pattern of root issues. Sometimes, issues may also be the same as the root issues. In others, the detection may be more difficult. For example, consider a manufacturing firm with several problems: sales are not growing as expected; customers are returning products; customer satisfaction with the product quality is declining; and rework has increased. The root issue, lack of quality control, causes the other issues. Specifically, there was no quality control in the production process. The absence of quality control led to more rework and to the shipping of defective products, which the customers then returned or refused to buy again, and persuaded others not to buy.\r\nIt is identification of the root issues that enables the student to specify succinctly what is wrong with an organization. Proper identification requires close reading of the entire case, including appendices. Some information may have little or no bearing on the issues. As in the real-life situations that case analysis seeks to emulate, the student must sift carefully through all discernible aspects of a situation in order to determine what is relevant.\r\nAnalysis\r\nAnalysis and issue identification are highly related. Analysis requires a thorough assessment of why an issue arose or exists, how various issues relate to each other, and which issues lead to others and are, therefore, the most crucial to an under standing of the root issues. The analysis section includes required quantitative analysis, e.g., cost-volume-profit variance analysis. The analysis discloses how well essential organizational functions are working, e.g., planning, controlling, and management information systems. Analysis can also reveal, when necessary, the strengths and weaknesses of the organization. The analysis may vary in complexity. It can be as simple as listing the supporting issues, or as complex as finding the root or underlying issues.\r\nSome case questions have a singular answer either because of the context or because of the \"required\". Other case questions lend themselves to a series of alternatives for solving issues. Alternatives should be individually meaningful and mutually exclusive. For example, for a business with serious profit problems, one alternative might be to reduce costs and focus on the core business. Another alternative might be to close the business and sell the assets and inventories. Each alternative must be explained and justified as an answer, and if appropriate, its advantages and disadvantages should be discussed.\r\nRecommendations\r\nThe recommendations are a student\'s approach to remedying the root issues. If there are alternatives, the recommendations should be selected from the alternatives discussed in the analysis section. In resolving the root issues, the recommendations must also resolve most of the other issues. Recommendations should be action oriented, decisive and unambiguous; i.e., they should explicitly resolve the issues, assign responsibilities and set deadlines.\r\nIt may be suitable to include a conclusion that deals with implementation, especially with timing, and the assignment of responsibilities that arise out of the recommendations.\r\nFor example, with respect to the organization with profit problems, a student might recommend cost cutting and focus on the core business alternative. The student should follow the selection of this alternative by specifying how he or she would resolve the profit problems, and by suggesting an implementation plan. The implementation should detail which costs are to be cut, by whom, and with what consequences. It should detail which businesses are to be eliminated\r\n\r\n and which ones are to remain. If sufficient information is available, the recommendations should be quantified, showing the expected profit improvement.\r\nIn the report writing stage, it is often more time efficient and effective to identify, analyze, and make recommendations for each root issue individually. It is nevertheless essential to show the integration of the various issues within the case. Whatever the approach, it should be justified as the most appropriate for the case question.\r\nUse of Turnitin\r\nTo uphold academic integrity, Turnitin will be used in this assessment. By submitting your work through Turnitin, Turnitin\'s software will compare your work against a repository of internet and library resources in addition to the work of your peers and other academics to generate a similarity report. This similarity report verifies that your work is your own and that any referenced material is appropriately cited.\r\nSubmission\r\nStudents should save their excel file as one PDF file for the instructor to mark. Save this PDF document according to the naming convention: GroupNameAssignment.pdf. Include the names of all group members on the first page of the PDF. Then, one member of the group needs to submit your assessment on behalf of all group members electronically to the Turnitin submission inbox at the bottom (Part 1).\r\nClick the \"Part 2\" tab at the top of the Turnitin Assignment to submit your excel file to show the calculations.\r\nAll course work submitted will require students in the course to complete and submit the academic integrity checklist. Please download the academic integrity checklist on the Assessment page and have one group member upload it under \"Academic Integrity Checklist\" tab at the top.\r\nNOTE: Assignments will be considered incomplete if they do not include the required academic integrity checklist.\r\nIt is your responsibility to verify if the submission was successful. Be sure to keep a backup copy of all your assignments in the event that they are lost in transition.\r\n', 'Accounting', 'Diploma', '[\"Report Writing\",\"Case Studies\"]', '[\"Management & Cost accounting\"]', '2022-10-25 21:45', '4200', 'C90BE42D-CB43-4DC6-8DDE-4228F9D73B58.jpeg_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Using research, identify the primary conflict drivers, key sources of insecurity, key stakeholders and their interests, and the interventions that have occurred or are occurring to keep and/or build peace. Apply the concepts and literature discussed in Weeks 1-6 to discuss the relevance of the security-development nexus in the context of this case study. This is a critical summary and assessment of the dynamics underpinning a particular conflict case study. You should engage with the course material to help you understand your case and clearly articulate your assessment (which is also your argument) of the conflict. Your conflict assessment should include the following:\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Introduce the conflict case study you have selected, and summarize your assessment into a clear and concise argument (you can think of this like a thesis statement â€“ it is a declarative articulation of the central argument being made in your conflict assessment) (e.g. â€˜While whole-of-government approaches have been attempted in in this context, interventions have failed to address one of the primary conflict drivers, thereby excluding a key stakeholder for peacebuilding). Answer the â€œso what?â€ of your assessment (e.g. The ongoing conflict in this context has led to mass migration, disruption of livelihoods, and has exacerbated the economic challenges this region faces. Failure to address this important conflict driver and include this key stakeholder in resolution efforts, risks this conflict becoming intractable).\r\n\r\nConflict Drivers: Identify and briefly explain the causes of conflict and the primary grievances that have led to violence in this context. Who are the key players? What are they disputing? Are external actors involved? Etc.\r\n\r\nSources of Insecurity: How is the conflict impacting civilians? What are the primary results of the violence? (e.g. economic precarity, displacement, sexual and gender based violence, genocide, political marginalization, etc.)\r\n\r\nKey Stakeholders and their Interests: In this section, detail who has interests in the conflict or who may be impacted by how the conflict plays out. This is not the warring parties (as these should be discussed in the Conflict Drivers section), but is rather about what other actors may impact or be impacted by how the conflict plays out in your case study context. These may include international actors, transnational forces, corporations, non-state groups, political parties,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nInterventions: Overview the types of peace-related interventions that have taken place in your case study. Have those interventions been successful or faced serious challenges? Have those interventions employed efforts at policy coherence by combining or harmonizing security and development? Based on your assessment of the conflict dynamics, what is missing from the interventions that have been tried or are being tried?', 'Social Science', 'Bachelors', '[\"Essay Writing\"]', '[\"Social Science\"]', '2022-11-01 12:00', '3000', 'Midterm Assignment - Conflict Assessment.pdf_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '13', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.\r\n\r\nEdgar F.

Your report should demonstrate wide reading and comprehension of the theoretical frameworks introduced in the module. You are expected to draw on key concepts and frameworks to analyse the process of launching new ventures. Good reports will draw on theoretical concepts to show understanding of the challenges typically encountered when creating a new venture. This may include frameworks explaining the influence of uncertainty and related knowledge problems on new ventures; strategies for creating new firms, the foundersâ€™ role, and how entrepreneurs can overcome challenges such as resource dependency and liabilities of newness/scale.\r\n\r\nPart 2: A Self-reflection (30%)  Written in the first person (I) this part of the report should demonstrate your personal understanding of the process of creating a new venture. You do not need to draw on theoretical frameworks in Part 2. Instead, you can draw on previous entrepreneurial experiences (e.g., founding your own firm, working for start-ups, entrepreneurial competitions (e.g., Ingenuity) internships, family business etc). It may also be helpful to draw on your experiences during this module. For example, what insights did you gain from designing a Business Model for a new venture? What might you do differently? Finally, you may project into the future to consider how you would approach the process of launching a new venture. Have you gained any insights from this module that you would use in the future if you were creating your own venture or joining a start-up?\r\n\r\nSome key points to consider:\r\n\r\n1)   The individual report requires two parts: Part 1 is a standard academic essay with references, introduction, discussion, and conclusion. Part 2 is a self-reflection written in the first person (I) and based on your personal understanding of the process of launching a new venture.\r\n\r\n2)   A marking rubric for the individual report is provided on Moodle.

Here, you should draw on practitioner sources such as the trade press (e.g. Marketing Week), newspaper articles (e.g. The Guardian) and news sources (e.g. BBC), and blogs, articles and websites written by credible industry commentators and experts. \r\nRecommendations for how the fictitious company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their future marketing communications.\r\nIn this way, your Company Briefing Paper will pull together the academic literature on a topic with examples drawn from marketing practice. Employers put a high value on candidates who can demonstrate skills in critical thinking, synthesising (bringing together) material from different sources, and analysing complex material.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should choose any ONE of the fictitious companies shown below as the focal company for your Company Briefing Paper. \r\n\r\nCompany A: Get Fit Now is a new pay-as-you go gym, targeting consumers who have become disillusioned by high joining and membership fees of health clubs. As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place.  \r\n\r\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience. The products are positioned as fun, stylish, â€œmust-haveâ€ items aimed at encouraging young girls (12-17 years old) to get into a regular hair care routine.\r\n\r\nCompany C:  Nice Ice is a chain of ice cream cafes targeted at teenagers and their parents. Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\r\n\r\nCompany D:  Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable. It is targeted at consumers who need to replace their phone whilst reducing their impact on the environment. The companyâ€™s marketing objective is to seize a 10% market share in the mobile phone market in year 1 by building awareness and trial rapidly.\r\n\r\nKey elements of a Company Briefing Paper\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is an indicative list only of what should be included in your work, it is not a running order or list of contents: thus, the logic and flow of material is up to you to decide.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to the paper (what is the purpose of the paper and what it will cover?)\r\nCritical analysis and discussion of academic theory in your chosen topic area. You should aim to focus your discussion on any issue that you consider to be of relevance/ importance/ interest â€“ but â€“ be careful to scope it in. Do not be tempted to cover too many issues.  Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another â€“ thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth. For example, is there an area of controversy or divided opinion in the subject area, e.g. where researchers have found different or conflicting results?\r\nExamples â€“ integrate practitioner sources to demonstrate how the issues raised in your review of the academic literature are used /applied in the case of at least two companies/ organisations/ brands in their marketing communications\r\nConclusions and recommendations: what conclusion do you draw from the review of the academic literature?  Based on this, what recommendations would you make to the Marketing Director of your chosen fictitious company?\r\nReferences: ALL sources used in the work must be shown in accurate Harvard style, including the in-text citations and the Reference list at the end of the work.\r\nAppendices are optional and should be used only if there is a need to include any supporting information.\r\nPresentation style â€“ your paper must be presented to professional standards and demonstrate a coherent structure.  It should include a title page, contents page, page numbers, and a clear system of appropriate headings and sub-headings.\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 2 â€“ Reflective statement on the research process\r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper requires you to find, evaluate and use information drawn from a range of academic and practitioner sources. The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\r\n\r\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\r\n\r\nHow did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\r\nWhat did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\r\nHow might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\r\n The reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as a separate document.', 'BBA ', 'Bachelors', '[\"Report Writing\"]', '[\"English (Writing and spoken)\"]', '2023-04-11 05:00', '6000 -7000', 'Marketing communications.docx_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

You will write up an up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area, as well as some recommendations to a fictitious company (to be chosen from a list of four) on how this company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their \r\nfuture marketing communications.\r\n\r\nThe individual assignment comprises of three elements:\r\n\r\n1.    A fully-referenced Company Briefing Paper (2,000 words maximum)\r\n\r\n2.    A reflective statement on the research process (200 words maximum)\r\n\r\n3.

Your chosen topic designates you as an â€œExpertâ€ at the relevant Roundtable Experts & Novices workshop sessions (see Element 3 below).\r\n\r\nPlease note that a limited number of places will be available for each topic, therefore you should choose a secondary topic as a back-up. A topic sign-up list will be available on Canvas closer to the time.\r\n\r\nÂ·       Brand placement\r\n\r\nÂ·       Sponsorship\r\n\r\nÂ·       Ethics in Marketing Communications\r\n\r\nÂ·       Customer Journey Communications\r\n\r\nÂ·       Interactive/Digital & mobile communications\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper must be written in the 3rd person and provide the Marketing Director of a fictitious company (see below for choice of companies) with the following:\r\n\r\nAn up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area\r\ndrawing on an absolute minimum of two carefully selected academic journal \r\narticles and on a range of at least ten diverse sources.  \r\nIntegrate into your discussion at least two examples of how the academic theory reviewed is used/ applied by brands/ companies in current practice. Here, you should draw on practitioner sources such as the trade press (e.g. Marketing Week), newspaper articles (e.g. The Guardian) and news sources (e.g. BBC), and blogs, articles and websites written by credible industry commentators and experts. \r\nRecommendations for how the fictitious company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their future marketing communications.\r\nIn this way, your Company Briefing Paper will pull together the academic literature on a topic with examples drawn from marketing practice. Employers put a high value on candidates who can demonstrate skills in critical thinking, synthesising (bringing together) material from different sources, and analysing complex material.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should choose any ONE of the fictitious companies shown below as the focal company for your Company Briefing Paper. \r\n\r\nCompany A: Get Fit Now is a new pay-as-you go gym, targeting consumers who have become disillusioned by high joining and membership fees of health clubs. As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place.  \r\n\r\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience. The products are positioned as fun, stylish, â€œmust-haveâ€ items aimed at encouraging young girls (12-17 years old) to get into a regular hair care routine.\r\n\r\nCompany C:  Nice Ice is a chain of ice cream cafes targeted at teenagers and their parents. Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\r\n\r\nCompany D:  Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable. It is targeted at consumers who need to replace their phone whilst reducing their impact on the environment. The companyâ€™s marketing objective is to seize a 10% market share in the mobile phone market in year 1 by building awareness and trial rapidly.\r\n\r\nKey elements of a Company Briefing Paper\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is an indicative list only of what should be included in your work, it is not a running order or list of contents: thus, the logic and flow of material is up to you to decide.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to the paper (what is the purpose of the paper and what it will cover?)\r\nCritical analysis and discussion of academic theory in your chosen topic area. You should aim to focus your discussion on any issue that you consider to be of relevance/ importance/ interest â€“ but â€“ be careful to scope it in. Do not be tempted to cover too many issues.  Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another â€“ thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth. For example, is there an area of controversy or divided opinion in the subject area, e.g. where researchers have found different or conflicting results?\r\nExamples â€“ integrate practitioner sources to demonstrate how the issues raised in your review of the academic literature are used /applied in the case of at least two companies/ organisations/ brands in their marketing communications\r\nConclusions and recommendations: what conclusion do you draw from the review of the academic literature?  Based on this, what recommendations would you make to the Marketing Director of your chosen fictitious company?\r\nReferences: ALL sources used in the work must be shown in accurate Harvard style, including the in-text citations and the Reference list at the end of the work.\r\nAppendices are optional and should be used only if there is a need to include any supporting information.\r\nPresentation style â€“ your paper must be presented to professional standards and demonstrate a coherent structure.  It should include a title page, contents page, page numbers, and a clear system of appropriate headings and sub-headings.\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 2 â€“ Reflective statement on the research process\r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper requires you to find, evaluate and use information drawn from a range of academic and practitioner sources. The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\r\n\r\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\r\n\r\nHow did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\r\nWhat did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\r\nHow might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\r\n The reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as a separate document.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 3 â€“Experts and Novices Roundtable Sessions\r\n\r\nFive Roundtable Experts & Novices sessions in Teaching Block 2 take the form of expert and student-led, co-created workshops, where students take on the role of either an â€œExpertâ€ or a â€œNoviceâ€ and work together to share and develop knowledge about the topics for the Company Briefing Paper.\r\n\r\nFollowing from Element 1 above, your chosen literature review topic designates you as an â€œExpertâ€ at the relevant roundtable session.  For the roundtable sessions where the topic is not your chosen literature review topic, you are a â€œNoviceâ€.  Everyone will therefore be an â€œExpertâ€ at one session and a â€œNoviceâ€ at the other four sessions.\r\n\r\nAttendance at the Roundtable Expert and Novices workshop sessions is mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshops is to develop subject knowledge and help you prepare for the assignment. You will also develop your research skills as well as gain confidence in your ability to explain the results of your research to others. Employers place high importance on communication and listening skills, and the Experts and Novices sessions will enable you to practice and hone your talents in both areas.  \r\n\r\nIn preparation for the workshops you are required to find and read at least four academic journal papers on your chosen literature review topic and prepare a written summary of your findings in the form of a Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). \r\n\r\nThe Critical Thinking module on Canvas provides resources to help you produce your TAG, and enrolment on the module is recommended:  https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/7439\r\n\r\nGiven the co-created nature of these sessions, their success depends entirely on everyone taking responsibility for their part in the sessions and the impact of this on others. This means actively participating in the workshops and coming prepared, i.e. having done the reading and produced the required TAG preparation paper. Specifically:\r\n\r\nExperts must find and read at least four academic journal articles* in their chosen topic area and prepare a written summary of these articles in the form of a fully-referenced Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). In your designated Expert workshop session, you will use your TAG paper as the basis for your explanation about your topic to a small group of Novices.\r\nExperts must also find examples of how brands/companies have used/ applied the theory in practice, to illustrate your findings to your Novices.\r\nNovices must read the relevant content in Fill & Turnbull (2019) or at least ONE academic journal article in order to gain a basic understanding of the topic AND find examples to discuss in class. Be ready to ask questions of your Expert.\r\nDuring the roundtable sessions, after the Experts have shared their findings with the Novices, Experts and Novices will work together to apply the theory to a practical scenario and produce recommendations for practice.\r\nAt the end of every roundtable both Experts and Novices are required to complete a Contribution Sheet that reflects on your input into the sessions and what you got out of them. You must submit a satisfactory Contribution Sheet in order to gain your marks for each workshop roundtable.\r\n \r\n', 'BBA', 'Bachelors', '[\"Report Writing\"]', '[\"Marketing Communication\"]', '2023-03-30 09:00', '4000', 'Measuring ambush marketing and sponsorship effects a football consumer response approach.pdf_$_Less Sponsorship As Advertising and More Sponsorship Linked Marketing As Authentic Engagement.pdf_$_Sponsorship-linked_marketing_ (1).pdf_$_Sponsorship-linked_marketing_.pdf_$_Tax sheet for Adarsh.docx_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

For the sake of clarity, unlike on some modules there is no percentage allowance for excess words: the limit is 2000 words exactly. (For the sake of clarity, unlike on some modules there is no percentage allowance for excess words: the limit is 2000 words exactly.)\r\nThis does not include reference lists and bibliographies although citations in the main body of your assignment do count. The words in the question itself, which will be your title, do not count against the word limit.\r\nDo not include a summary at the beginning of the essay, as well as your introduction: that would count against the word limit, and you would risk a deduction of marks for repetition.\r\nDo not use appendices: they would also count against the word limit and in any case the evidence supporting your argument should be in the main body of your essay.\r\nGuidance on the coursework assignments\r\n1. To answer any of the coursework questions, you will need to draw upon your learning from the seminars. You should expect to use examples which you examined in preparatory study for and in discussion during the seminars for this module.\r\n2. Use and compare two or three case studies to illustrate and support your arguments. You can draw cases from the articles and books suggested in the reading lists, in particular from the reading lists for the seminar tasks. Supplement the information on these cases by searching using the QMUL library, to find additional peer reviewed articles and also look for major investigative reports.\r\n3. Donâ€™t just describe. Focus your answer on causal processes which explain the outcomes for risk management which you want to argue in, in response to the specific question set.\r\n4. Ensure that your answer draws on material covered week 1-8 of the module.\r\nCoursework questions\r\nSelect one of the following three questions and write an essay of not more than 2000 words in answer to it.\r\n1. Enterprise risk management: Assess the evidence for and the limitations of the main arguments made by at least three advocates and by at least three critics of enterprise risk management (ERM). In particular, assess the evidence for their rival claims about its\r\n\r\npracticality in implementation, effectiveness and capacity to limit the effect of bias, for different kinds of businesses and organisations, for different kinds of risks, and for different phases of the business cycle.\r\nSupport your analysis of the strengths and weakness of the advocatesâ€™ and the criticsâ€™ cases by comparing either cases of attempts to implement ERM either in (a) two contrasting industries or (b) in two firms of very different sizes.\r\n2. Risk perception / communication: Under what conditions and with what risk communication strategies, if any, can companies succeed in reassuring consumers who are sceptical of the safety of a companyâ€™s products or services and local residents living or working near a companyâ€™s hazardous site or plant or operations?\r\nSupport your analysis by comparing evidence about conditions for success and strategies from two industries, one of which should be concerned with risk communication to consumers about product or service safety and the other with risk communication to local residents about operational safety. Both cases should concern routine business work, not crisis or post-crisis conditions. Identify key differences and similarities between these contexts.\r\n3. Project risk in mega-projects: Why does the implementation of project risk management procedures so often fail to reduce project risks in mega-projects? Review empirical evidence from research and assess the relative importance of at least four different factors.\r\nSupport your analysis by comparing cases of more and less successful mega-projects, where risk management procedures were implemented in each case, even in the less successful project.\r\nGeneral advice\r\n- Answer the exact question set.\r\n- Structure your essay carefully, with a clear introduction that â€˜signpostsâ€™ the sequence of the argument to be made out, a main body of argument, and a conclusion which integrates the whole argument.\r\n- Support your answer with carefully marshalled, ordered and sequenced presentations of empirical evidence, setting out your reasons for answer to the question in full.\r\n- Use empirical cases and evidence to illustrate your argument.\r\n- Use the literature in the field critically.\r\n- Define and explain key concepts when you introduce them.\r\nCommon mistakes to avoid\r\n1. Being vague â€“ e.g., failing to define key terms, writing obscurely, failing to be clear and unambiguous.\r\n2. Over-claiming â€“ claiming too much, claiming more than your evidence really supports.\r\n3. Asserting rather than arguing â€“ failing to support your claims with empirical evidence\r\nand logically related reasons.\r\n4. Swithering â€“ arguing for one answer to the question set in one part of the essay and\r\nthen arguing for a quite different or even opposite answer in another part of the essay.\r\n5. Being indecisive â€“ writing a â€˜on the one hand ... and on the other ...â€™ answer to the\r\nquestion set that does not come down clearly in favour of one answer to it.\r\n6. Not considering the limitations of at least one opposing case, if only briefly.\r\n\r\n7. Presenting a conclusion that does not follow from the argument or the evidence.\r\n8. Trying to rely on knowledge drawn from other modules.\r\n9. Writing without a well-thought out structure â€“ e.g., no evident and logical sequence of\r\npoints that build up to a step-by-step argument to a conclusion.\r\n10. Being uncritical and not being thoughtful â€“ e.g., taking the conventional â€˜textbookâ€™\r\nwisdom for granted, without interrogating it, without examining whether the evidence\r\nsupports it.\r\n11. Summarising â€“ just summarising what leading authors have written, without making an\r\nargument of your own.\r\n12. Writing about the topic rather than answering the exact question set.\r\n13. Being too simple â€“ e.g., assuming practice will mechanically follow rules set in laws or\r\nobjectives of programmes, taking simple abstract and theoretical differences between\r\nindustries for granted, over-generalising about fields.\r\n14. Presenting your essay poorly â€“ e.g., writing illegibly, not making your paragraph breaks clear and\r\nobvious, not numbering and indenting key points in those cases where this would be helpful to the reader in understanding some steps in your argument.\r\nFormat\r\nâ–ª All work must be typed and submitted in MS Word or Adobe PDF format\r\nâ–ª Font size should be 12 point (unless otherwise specified)\r\nâ–ª Font style should be Arial\r\nâ–ª Lines should be double-spaced\r\nâ–ª Leave margins for comment Insert page numbers\r\nâ–ª Use a header containing your student ID number, the module code to which your work\r\napplies, and the date\r\nâ–ª Always spell-check and proof read your work before handing it in (once you have\r\nsubmitted your work you will not be permitted to retrieve it)\r\nâ–ª Keep your own electronic back-up copy of your work and if possible save on two\r\ndevices\r\nâ–ª Avoid plagiarism\r\nâ–ª Submit your work on time\r\nLate submissions\r\n1. Coursework submitted late (and there are no extenuating circumstances) will incur a late penalty. Five per cent of the total marks available shall be deducted for every period of 24 hours, or part thereof, that an assignment is overdue there shall be a deduction of five per cent of the total marks available (i.e. five marks for an assessment marked out of 100). After seven calendar days (168 hours or more late) the mark shall be reduced to zero, and recorded as 0FL (zero, fail, late).\r\n2. Each module has word limits for coursework assignments; however, the decision about whether to impose a penalty mark for exceeding the word limit is made by each module organiser. You must check the module handbook and the assignment briefing documents to see whether the particular module organiser has adopted a penalty system. It is your responsibility to read the handbook and assignment briefing carefully. If no penalty is specified then the module organiser will take into account the word length under the standard marking conventions. For example, if you have exceeded the word limit then it might be that you have not been sufficiently succinct or focused in your assignment and therefore might be penalised for these weaknesses. Please note that word limits do NOT\r\n\r\n3. 4.\r\n5.\r\n6. 7.\r\n8.\r\ninclude references or appendices.

You will write up an up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area, as well as some recommendations to a fictitious company (to be chosen from a list of four) on how this company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their \r\nfuture marketing communications.\r\n\r\nThe individual assignment comprises of three elements:\r\n\r\n1. A fully-referenced Company Briefing Paper (2,000 words maximum)\r\n\r\n2. A reflective statement on the research process (200 words maximum)\r\n\r\n3. Preparation for and contribution to five â€œExperts and Novicesâ€ roundtables, including a TAG (Thematic Analysis Grid). \r\n\r\n The task\r\n\r\nElement 1 â€“ Company Briefing Paper\r\n\r\nYou should choose one of the topics below as the subject of 2,000 words (maximum) fully-referenced Company Briefing Paper. Your chosen topic designates you as an â€œExpertâ€ at the relevant Roundtable Experts & Novices workshop sessions (see Element 3 below).\r\n\r\nPlease note that a limited number of places will be available for each topic, therefore you should choose a secondary topic as a back-up. A topic sign-up list will be available on Canvas closer to the time.\r\n\r\nÂ· Brand placement\r\n\r\nÂ· Sponsorship\r\n\r\nÂ· Ethics in Marketing Communications\r\n\r\nÂ· Customer Journey Communications\r\n\r\nÂ· Interactive/Digital & mobile communications\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper must be written in the 3rd person and provide the Marketing Director of a fictitious company (see below for choice of companies) with the following:\r\n\r\nAn up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area\r\ndrawing on an absolute minimum of two carefully selected academic journal \r\narticles and on a range of at least ten diverse sources. \r\nIntegrate into your discussion at least two examples of how the academic theory reviewed is used/ applied by brands/ companies in current practice. Here, you should draw on practitioner sources such as the trade press (e.g. Marketing Week), newspaper articles (e.g. The Guardian) and news sources (e.g. BBC), and blogs, articles and websites written by credible industry commentators and experts. \r\nRecommendations for how the fictitious company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their future marketing communications.\r\nIn this way, your Company Briefing Paper will pull together the academic literature on a topic with examples drawn from marketing practice. Employers put a high value on candidates who can demonstrate skills in critical thinking, synthesising (bringing together) material from different sources, and analysing complex material.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should choose any ONE of the fictitious companies shown below as the focal company for your Company Briefing Paper. \r\n\r\nCompany A: Get Fit Now is a new pay-as-you go gym, targeting consumers who have become disillusioned by high joining and membership fees of health clubs. As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place. \r\n\r\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience. The products are positioned as fun, stylish, â€œmust-haveâ€ items aimed at encouraging young girls (12-17 years old) to get into a regular hair care routine.\r\n\r\nCompany C: Nice Ice is a chain of ice cream cafes targeted at teenagers and their parents. Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\r\n\r\nCompany D: Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable. It is targeted at consumers who need to replace their phone whilst reducing their impact on the environment. The companyâ€™s marketing objective is to seize a 10% market share in the mobile phone market in year 1 by building awareness and trial rapidly.\r\n\r\nKey elements of a Company Briefing Paper\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is an indicative list only of what should be included in your work, it is not a running order or list of contents: thus, the logic and flow of material is up to you to decide.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to the paper (what is the purpose of the paper and what it will cover?)\r\nCritical analysis and discussion of academic theory in your chosen topic area. You should aim to focus your discussion on any issue that you consider to be of relevance/ importance/ interest â€“ but â€“ be careful to scope it in. Do not be tempted to cover too many issues. Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another â€“ thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth. For example, is there an area of controversy or divided opinion in the subject area, e.g. where researchers have found different or conflicting results?\r\nExamples â€“ integrate practitioner sources to demonstrate how the issues raised in your review of the academic literature are used /applied in the case of at least two companies/ organisations/ brands in their marketing communications\r\nConclusions and recommendations: what conclusion do you draw from the review of the academic literature? Based on this, what recommendations would you make to the Marketing Director of your chosen fictitious company?\r\nReferences: ALL sources used in the work must be shown in accurate Harvard style, including the in-text citations and the Reference list at the end of the work.\r\nAppendices are optional and should be used only if there is a need to include any supporting information.\r\nPresentation style â€“ your paper must be presented to professional standards and demonstrate a coherent structure. It should include a title page, contents page, page numbers, and a clear system of appropriate headings and sub-headings.\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 2 â€“ Reflective statement on the research process\r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper requires you to find, evaluate and use information drawn from a range of academic and practitioner sources. The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\r\n\r\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\r\n\r\nHow did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\r\nWhat did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\r\nHow might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\r\n The reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as a separate document.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 3 â€“Experts and Novices Roundtable Sessions\r\n\r\nFive Roundtable Experts & Novices sessions in Teaching Block 2 take the form of expert and student-led, co-created workshops, where students take on the role of either an â€œExpertâ€ or a â€œNoviceâ€ and work together to share and develop knowledge about the topics for the Company Briefing Paper.\r\n\r\nFollowing from Element 1 above, your chosen literature review topic designates you as an â€œExpertâ€ at the relevant roundtable session. For the roundtable sessions where the topic is not your chosen literature review topic, you are a â€œNoviceâ€. Everyone will therefore be an â€œExpertâ€ at one session and a â€œNoviceâ€ at the other four sessions.\r\n\r\nAttendance at the Roundtable Expert and Novices workshop sessions is mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshops is to develop subject knowledge and help you prepare for the assignment. You will also develop your research skills as well as gain confidence in your ability to explain the results of your research to others. Employers place high importance on communication and listening skills, and the Experts and Novices sessions will enable you to practice and hone your talents in both areas. \r\n\r\nIn preparation for the workshops you are required to find and read at least four academic journal papers on your chosen literature review topic and prepare a written summary of your findings in the form of a Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). \r\n\r\nThe Critical Thinking module on Canvas provides resources to help you produce your TAG, and enrolment on the module is recommended: https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/7439\r\n\r\nGiven the co-created nature of these sessions, their success depends entirely on everyone taking responsibility for their part in the sessions and the impact of this on others. This means actively participating in the workshops and coming prepared, i.e. having done the reading and produced the required TAG preparation paper. Specifically:\r\n\r\nExperts must find and read at least four academic journal articles* in their chosen topic area and prepare a written summary of these articles in the form of a fully-referenced Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). In your designated Expert workshop session, you will use your TAG paper as the basis for your explanation about your topic to a small group of Novices.\r\nExperts must also find examples of how brands/companies have used/ applied the theory in practice, to illustrate your findings to your Novices.\r\nNovices must read the relevant content in Fill & Turnbull (2019) or at least ONE academic journal article in order to gain a basic understanding of the topic AND find examples to discuss in class. Be ready to ask questions of your Expert.\r\nDuring the roundtable sessions, after the Experts have shared their findings with the Novices, Experts and Novices will work together to apply the theory to a practical scenario and produce recommendations for practice.\r\nAt the end of every roundtable both Experts and Novices are required to complete a Contribution Sheet that reflects on your input into the sessions and what you got out of them. You must submit a satisfactory Contribution Sheet in order to gain your marks for each workshop roundtable.\r\n \r\n', 'Bba', 'Bachelors', '[\"Report Writing\"]', '[\"Marketing Communication\"]', '2023-03-24 09:19', '4000', '90B8737C-BCE6-40E3-BD29-6512FADBCFC5.pdf_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Royce is also \r\ncommitted to supporting the LGBTQ+ community by manufacturing bras, for example, for \r\npeople who identify as transgender.\r\nThey never want to stand still because their markets are permanently evolving and changing. \r\nThey always aim to be ahead of the competition and know what the â€˜big pictureâ€™ changes and \r\nthe important â€˜zeitgeistâ€™ trends are.\r\nTherefore, OBBC is pitching now to help Royce Lingerie prepare for a future brand positioning\r\nthat takes latest broader societal trends as well as a comprehensive market analysis into \r\naccount. Due to time constraints, OBBC decides for the initial pitch phase to focus\r\ngeographically on the UK market only. For more details, see www.royce-lingerie.co.uk\r\nOne of the key challenges is to attract new and younger target audiences without losing older \r\nloyal customers.\r\nYour report needs to cover the following elements\r\n\r\n ANALYSIS: What is this brand about? What are the key meanings, manifestations \r\nand stakeholders of the brand? What does the â€˜productâ€™ portfolio currently look like? \r\nWhat are the brandâ€™s current vision, mission and core values? What are the \r\nstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats? How is the brand currently \r\npositioned? Your analysis is expected to look at a variety of elements of the brand. \r\nThis should include the brandâ€™s IDEOLOGY, CAPABILITIES, \r\nCONSUMERS/STAKEHOLDERS, COMPETITION and ENVIRONMENT. \r\nMark allocation: 30%\r\n \r\nSTRATEGY: Based on your analysis, you are expected to discuss two different \r\npotential future positioning options for the brand which could be established in the UK \r\nmarket in autumn/winter 2023. You then need to justify/evaluate which of the \r\ndiscussed positionings has the most potential, i.e. you need to choose one \r\npositioning option and justify your decision. You can extend a positioning strategy \r\nthat already exists, but you need to justify why this is the best option. Finally, you are \r\nexpected to make suggestions as to how the brand positioning idea could be \r\ntransformed into strategic frameworks that can be used to brief the clientâ€™s marketing \r\nteam who need to bring this positioning idea to life. In this context you must apply \r\none or more of the following frameworks: (a) SBM Vision, Mission & Values; (b) SBM \r\nBrand Pyramid; and/or (c) Transformation Grid. \r\nMark allocation: 30%\r\n\r\n IMPLEMENTATION: Based on your strategic framework(s), you need to develop \r\nand explain implementation activities to show how, for example, the clientâ€™s UK \r\nmarketing team could implement the core strategic idea which you have developed\r\nwith different specific stakeholders. This needs to contain an activity in terms of co-\r\ncreative new product development. One implementation activity needs to utilise \r\nsocial media-based communications or other latest digital technology. \r\nMark allocation: 30%\r\nThe remaining 10% are allocated for the quality of the presentation of the assignment.

You \r\nmust support your decisions with academic references as well as other secondary sources. \r\nTherefore, you must search for and use relevant information on the brand, but you are NOT \r\nexpected to conduct primary empirical research as part of the assignment.\r\n\r\nMust not contact the client at all.\r\nThe information shared here needs to be 100% confidential or I\'ll get in big trouble as this is an actual client not a fictional one just for the assignment.', 'Msc.

The aim of this assessment is to enable you to develop and demonstrate your ability to: (a) diagnose a problem in business and management, (b) formulate research questions, determine how to answer these questions by drawing on the academic literature, identify and assess the potential of appropriate research methods and (e) plan a small-scale research project.\r\nThis report is among the most challenging assignments set during your M.Sc. programme. You should note that it is quite different from, and more challenging than, writing a conventional coursework essay-style paper. You are being asked to anticipate the issues that you will have to overcome in planning, conducting and reporting a small research project. The best research proposals are usually those produced by those students who have devoted considerable thought to the assignment before even beginning to write the proposal. It is not an assignment that can be left to the last minute.\r\nYour choice of problem for the project proposal report does not commit you to that topic for your dissertation. You can just complete the report as a free-standing exercise in which you are assessed on your competences as indicated in your ability to analyse a problem, grasp the arguments and the evidence contained in the literature, devise a suitable research design and present it effectively. You are free to select a different topic for your dissertation if you so wish, although there are obvious advantages in sticking to a topic to which you have already given thought and invested some work. However, you must avoid cutting-and-pasting parts of the proposal into the dissertation.

', 'You can use the social-self theory to explore how consumers seek to maintain or restore their sense of belonging and identity through consumption.\r\n\r\nUsing self-identity theory, identify and evaluate a contemporary societal challenge that is influencing the consumption behaviour of consumers. Develop conclusions from your evaluation. Use these conclusions to develop a â€˜future imaginationâ€™ of how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\r\nYour evaluation must include a critical appraisal of self-identity theory to inform your arguments. Additionally you must include evidence of relevant changing consumption behaviours and predictions from relevant experts. You must develop your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ from your conclusions. \r\nIn addressing the above question, you are advised to make the following choices:\r\n1)	Choose a specific consumer segment who engage in a specific consumption behaviour occurring in response to a societal challenge. You can phrase this as a problem or opportunity. \r\n2)	Focus on one consumer segment pertinent to your topic and country/sector choice. You should develop a profile of this segment, providing as much pertinent information as you can, e.g. using sociodemographics, psychographics. Please present visually or in table format, fully referenced.\r\n3)	Focus on one country for your essay. Having this focus will make it a lot easier for you to identify and evaluate the evidence within the word limit specified.\r\n4)	While you are required to use self-identity theory for your essay, you MUST focus on a specific concept, model or framework within it. For example, the self-concept model, social-self, pro-environmental self-identity, pro-social self-identity, body image, etc. Choose ONE of these. Do NOT include multiple identity frameworks/ models in your essay because this will undermine the depth of analysis you can achieve within the 3000 word count limit.\r\nOnce you make the above choices, you are required to investigate research evidence from academic articles, news from legitimate sources, industry reports etc. to critically analyse how consumer behaviour has changed in response to the societal issue you have identified. Building from this appraisal, you will explain, evaluate and apply your identity framework/model to your chosen issue. This will enable you to develop evidence-based analytical conclusions, from which you can create your future imagination.\r\n\r\nYou should draw on a good range of high quality academic and expert opinion sources to construct solid arguments for your paper. You should use relevant examples and data to support your claims. Ensure you fully reference all sources of information.\r\nYou are required to write a critique of transforming/transformed consumer behaviour, informed by contextual information, evidence and relevant theory. Your critique will involve you assessing varied data, ideas and scholarship from varied sources. Be adventurous in your searching but note the advice given to you on reputable sources. \r\nYou must focus on one framework/model of identity theory in your essay. This will really help you to develop a stronger critical appraisal to show your understanding and critical thinking. \r\nYou must choose only one country and one consumer segment. Within this country and segment, try to analyse your chosen CB transformation broadly and briefly. Then narrow down again to your chosen sector/industry/segment and again articulate this transformation. You now have an explanation that is country, sector and consumer specific. Now that you have this foundation, you can begin to build your academic arguments by integrating your chosen identity theory. Continuously, apply and evaluate your theory to your country/sector/segment otherwise your context and theory risk being disconnected. Lastly, extrapolate your conclusions to a 5-10 year future in order to imagine how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. \r\nYou must ensure the evidence you use to compile your paper relates to your choices (i.e. do not use American evidence to discuss China!). Preliminary reading will help you to make your choices. Whatever you choose to do, ensure you present your argument for your choices at the start of your paper â€“ and justify them. \r\nAssemble the evidence for your arguments, avoid unsubstantiated statements and bias - this is an objective investigation. It is essential that you critique your chosen theory and evidence, do not just describe it; evaluate the contribution it makes to our understanding of transforming/transformed consumer behaviour and how marketing to consumers (as customers or event participants) will evolve as a result in the future.\r\n\r\nGUIDELINES:\r\nPart 1: Introduction and Explanation (500-800 words): Introduce and examine your societal challenge, consumer segment and behaviour and country. Explain the issue clearly and its impact, citing supporting evidence and justify why it is worthy of exploration in your essay. Include a profile of your chosen consumer segment.\r\nPart 2: Evaluation and application of theoretical framework (1500-1800 words): Begin by giving an overview of identity theory, then focus on your chosen identity framework/model. Explain it and apply it to you challenge and context in part 1. Evaluate its contribution in explaining the CB transformation that is occurring, using scholarly research and evidence to support your arguments. Use examples throughout, pertinent to your focus. Images and illustrations can be used and add value to written arguments. \r\nPart 3: Conclusions (300-500 words): Develop conclusions based on your content in parts 1 and 2. Do not simply summarise your essay (this is not a conclusion). Your conclusions should be insightful and analytical and lead into your future appraisal. They should also demonstrate your learning from critically reviewing your chosen context and identity theory. Developing a â€˜visual mapâ€™ to illustrate this can be a useful communication tool; this is entirely up to you. Examples are discussed in the assignment briefings and clinics. Keep your writing style concise and focused. Numbering each conclusion will be helpful for cross referencing with your future appraisal. You could also consider these as a map for part 4.\r\nPart 4: The future (<500 words): This is where you get to be creative! Tell us, based on your analysis in part 1,2 and 3 your core ideas for imagining how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. Include specific examples of your chosen issue/segment/behaviour. You can present your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ as text and visually (we are not expecting artwork from you). Visualisation is encouraged and can include multiple formats, e.g. drawing, photographs, and digital images. Infographics are useful, using free software that is readily available. Check permissions for using any images that are not your own (and reference them as instructed by the owners).   \r\nMake sure your discussion of the future is connected and builds upon what you have stated in the body of your essay and is backed by evidence.\r\nPlease note: \r\nParts 1 and 2 need to be fully and extensively referenced. \r\nPart 3 will contain some pertinent references to support your insight e.g. from futurism, but should not repeat the full range of references in your theory review. Remember conclusions represent your critical thinking built from your prior analysis which you have already referenced. \r\nPart 4 does not require references, albeit you may need to reference some futurism insights if you include them here instead of in your conclusion (either place is fine). This section is showcasing your critical and creative thinking.\r\nThe use of subheadings to break up the essay is OK, however, please ensure you donâ€™t have too many as you risk hyper-fragmenting your essay, which may hamper the flow of discussion and subsequent analysis.\r\n', 'Msc. marketing', 'Masters', '[\"Essay Writing\"]', '[\"Consumer behaviour\"]', '2023-05-05 01:00', '5000', 'MARK7013 HB S2 2022-23.docx_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Develop conclusions from your evaluation. Use these conclusions to develop a â€˜future imaginationâ€™ of how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\r\nYour evaluation must include a critical appraisal of self-identity theory to inform your arguments. Additionally you must include evidence of relevant changing consumption behaviours and predictions from relevant experts. You must develop your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ from your conclusions.\r\nIn addressing the above question, you are advised to make the following choices:\r\n1) Choose a specific consumer segment who engage in a specific consumption behaviour occurring in response to a societal challenge. You can phrase this as a problem or opportunity. Here are some suggestions to help you to develop your own ideas. You do not need to choose from any of them. You can chose any combination that addresses the assignment question. Please ask your tutor if you are unsure:\r\nï€­ Climate change and sustainable development, e.g. eco-tourists and climate change, millennials and consumption reduction, activists and anti-consumption.\r\n Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\nï€­ The increasing interest in health and fitness is another potential area, including shifts that have occurred from the Covid-19 pandemic. Examples include a shift from in-person to online fitness classes. Growth in wearable health technology. Increasing membership of online health and wellbeing platforms.\r\nï€­ Advances and benefits of artificial intelligence in consumption choices. Examples include using an AI chatbot for a health care consultation. AI in agriculture (intelligent farming) to increase food availability/nutrition to mitigate food poverty and migration. AI designed to inform consumerâ€™s decision-making (e.g. online shopping â€“ getting purchasing right first time to prevent waste). Developing positive body image chatbots to promote a healthy body image among younger consumers.\r\nï€­ Shifts in dietary choices. For example, in response to food/water insecurity, biodiversity, and animal welfare considerations, as well as advances in food science and technology. This has supported shifts to â€˜different lifestylesâ€™ and created opportunities for food innovation development and lifestyles including vegan, flexitarian, anti-meat, artificial food e.g. lab-made â€˜meatâ€™.\r\nï€­ Economic constraints are also triggering CB changes, e.g. frugal consumption connected with growing poverty, consuming from â€˜foodbanksâ€™ and â€˜community fridgesâ€™. Sharing/leasing not buying, pre- owned/recycled/ repurposed are also an outcome of this, as well for ecological reasons (positive or negative depending on perspectives).\r\n2) Focusononeconsumersegmentpertinenttoyourtopicandcountry/sector choice. You should develop a profile of this segment, providing as much pertinent information as you can, e.g. using sociodemographics, psychographics. Please present visually or in table format, fully referenced.\r\n3) Focus on one country for your essay. Having this focus will make it a lot easier for you to identify and evaluate the evidence within the word limit specified.\r\n4) Whileyouarerequiredtouseself-identitytheoryforyouressay,youMUST focus on a specific concept, model or framework within it. For example, the self-concept model, social-self, pro-environmental self-identity, pro-social self- identity, body image, etc. Choose ONE of these. Do NOT include multiple identity frameworks/ models in your essay because this will undermine the depth of analysis you can achieve within the 3000 word count limit.\r\nOnce you make the above choices, you are required to investigate research evidence from academic articles, news from legitimate sources, industry reports etc. to critically analyse how consumer behaviour has changed in response to the societal issue you have identified. Building from this appraisal, you will explain,\r\n18\r\n Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\n\r\nevaluate and apply your identity framework/model to your chosen issue. This will enable you to develop evidence-based analytical conclusions, from which you can create your future imagination.\r\nGuidelines\r\nYou should draw on a good range of high quality academic and expert opinion sources to construct solid arguments for your paper. You should use relevant examples and data to support your claims. Ensure you fully reference all sources of information.\r\nYou are required to write a critique of transforming/transformed consumer behaviour, informed by contextual information, evidence and relevant theory. Your critique will involve you assessing varied data, ideas and scholarship from varied sources. Be adventurous in your searching but note the advice given to you on reputable sources.\r\nYou must focus on one framework/model of identity theory in your essay. This will really help you to develop a stronger critical appraisal to show your understanding and critical thinking.\r\nYou must choose only one country and one consumer segment. Within this country and segment, try to analyse your chosen CB transformation broadly and briefly. Then narrow down again to your chosen sector/industry/segment and again articulate this transformation. You now have an explanation that is country, sector and consumer specific. Now that you have this foundation, you can begin to build your academic arguments by integrating your chosen identity theory. Continuously, apply and evaluate your theory to your country/sector/segment otherwise your context and theory risk being disconnected. Lastly, extrapolate your conclusions to a 5-10 year future in order to imagine how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\r\nYou must ensure the evidence you use to compile your paper relates to your choices (i.e. do not use American evidence to discuss China!). Preliminary reading will help you to make your choices. Whatever you choose to do, ensure you present your argument for your choices at the start of your paper â€“ and justify them.\r\nAssemble the evidence for your arguments, avoid unsubstantiated statements and bias - this is an objective investigation.

For some authentic assessments, there may be an exception to this, so please confirm with your Module Leader.\r\nWe suggest the following format for your essay, which mimics the marking criteria listed in the table below, Please discuss with your seminar leader if you wish to depart from this structure:\r\nPart 1: Introduction and Explanation (500-800 words): Introduce and examine your societal challenge, consumer segment and behaviour and country. Explain the issue clearly and its impact, citing supporting evidence and justify why it is worthy of exploration in your essay. Include a profile of your chosen consumer segment.\r\nPart 2: Evaluation and application of theoretical framework (1500-1800 words): Begin by giving an overview of identity theory, then focus on your chosen identity framework/model. Explain it and apply it to you challenge and context in part 1. Evaluate its contribution in explaining the CB transformation that is occurring, using scholarly research and evidence to support your arguments. Use examples throughout, pertinent to your focus. Images and illustrations can be used and add value to written arguments.\r\n20\r\n  Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\n\r\nPart 3: Conclusions (300-500 words): Develop conclusions based on your content in parts 1 and 2. Do not simply summarise your essay (this is not a conclusion). Your conclusions should be insightful and analytical and lead into your future appraisal. They should also demonstrate your learning from critically reviewing your chosen context and identity theory. Developing a â€˜visual mapâ€™ to illustrate this can be a useful communication tool; this is entirely up to you. Examples are discussed in the assignment briefings and clinics. Keep your writing style concise and focused. Numbering each conclusion will be helpful for cross referencing with your future appraisal. You could also consider these as a map for part 4.\r\nPart 4: The future (<500 words): This is where you get to be creative! Tell us, based on your analysis in part 1,2 and 3 your core ideas for imagining how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. Include specific examples of your chosen issue/segment/behaviour. You can present your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ as text and visually (we are not expecting artwork from you). Visualisation is encouraged and can include multiple formats, e.g. drawing, photographs, and digital images. Infographics are useful, using free software that is readily available. Check permissions for using any images that are not your own (and reference them as instructed by the owners).\r\nMake sure your discussion of the future is connected and builds upon what you have stated in the body of your essay and is backed by evidence.\r\nPlease note:\r\nParts 1 and 2 need to be fully and extensively referenced.\r\nPart 3 will contain some pertinent references to support your insight e.g. from futurism, but should not repeat the full range of references in your theory review. Remember conclusions represent your critical thinking built from your prior analysis which you have already referenced.\r\nPart 4 does not require references, albeit you may need to reference some futurism insights if you include them here instead of in your conclusion (either place is fine). This section is showcasing your critical and creative thinking.\r\nThe use of subheadings to break up the essay is OK, however, please ensure you donâ€™t have too many as you risk hyper-fragmenting your essay, which may hamper the flow of discussion and subsequent analysis.\r\n\r\nmy topic- over dependence on technology in the USA on GenZ', 'International Business Management ', 'Masters', '[\"Essay Writing\"]', '[\"Consumer Behavior\"]', '2023-04-27 13:00', '3000', 'MARK7013 HB S2 2022-23 - Tagged.pdf_$_19228910_UCB_MARK7013.pdf_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Instructions and guidance\r\n           The aim of the proposal\r\nThe research proposal requires you to demonstrate your ability to identify, analyse a research problem related to business and management, and to set out a plan for a research project to investigate that problem. The aim of this assessment is to enable you to develop and demonstrate your ability to: (a) diagnose a problem in business and management, (b) arrive at the consequent research questions, (c) determine how to answer these questions by drawing on the academic literature, (d) assess the potential of different research methods and (e) plan a small-scale research project.  \r\nYour report is intended to form the plan for how you might use the literature (by drawing on the ideas and findings of others), design a research project and analyse the findings.  \r\nThis report is among the most challenging assignments set during the M.Sc. programmes.

You are free to select a different topic for your dissertation if you so wish, although there are obvious advantages in sticking to a topic to which you have already given thought and invested some work (although you must avoid cutting and-pasting parts of the proposal into the dissertation).  \r\n\r\n \r\n        The Research Proposal requirements\r\n        The report must include the following main elements: \r\n1.	Title. This can include a subtitle and should indicate what the research is essentially about. \r\n2.	Abstract. The abstract sums up the research problem/questions, research design and methods, and relation to the literature and/or practice. \r\n3.	Introduction in the form of an analysis of the problem to be addressed. This introductory material should include a clear statement of the problem, the question(s) to be researched, the importance of those questions and an indication of the potential role of business and management theories in answering the questions. The introduction should have clear labelling of the aim and objectives. \r\n4.	A summary critical review of the relevant literature, both theoretical and applied. This section should indicate what can be learnt from the current literature and will seek to identify some of the strengths and weaknesses of that literature. You are not expected to provide a comprehensive guide to the literature, but you are expected to communicate an understanding of some of the main theoretical ideas and presently available evidence relating to your topic. You must refer to the academic literature and not just to the professional literature (note that the former usually involves seeking an in-depth and critical understanding of problems while the latter is usually restricted to matters of \'how-to-do-it\'). \r\n5.	An outline of the proposed research design and methods. You should outline the research design and the likely methods, taking care to point to the strengths and weaknesses of your proposed research methods. You must outline a research project that can feasibly be done within the constraints of the M.Sc. dissertation process, indicate that you have good reason to believe that the necessary data is available and can be collected, that your choice of method(s) is appropriate and likely to produce reliable and valid results, and that you have considered any ethical questions raised by the research. \r\n6.	Conclusion. The conclusion summarizes the problem, the purposes of the study, the research question/s, and the methodology. It should also acknowledge any possible limitations of the approach \r\n(e.g. any problems of generalizability from limited number of cases). \r\n7.	Documentation: Appendix, references, and general presentation of the work. Using the Harvard approach to referencing and the references are done correctly in alphabetic order. You may include an appendix for any additional material you consider relevant, however the appendix will not be assessed. Diagrams and tables should be numbered, captioned, and presented correctly. \r\n\r\nTo pass the assignment, you must include all these key elements. However, you do not have to devote an equal number of words to each of them. In particular, the analysis of the problem is very likely to be shorter than the other elements. \r\nWhat you should NOT do (these reflect the failings of past research proposals)\r\nâ€¢	Do not write an essay about a general topic.  \r\nâ€¢	Do not just describe the application of a particular management technique or method (e.g. TQM, a project management technique), you must analyse the underlying problem and critically evaluate the alternative \'solutions\'. \r\nâ€¢	Do not write a literature review that is solely or largely dependent on pop management books or the professional rather than the academic literature. \r\nâ€¢	Do not write a literature review in the form of an annotated bibliography. \r\nâ€¢	Do not write a general essay on research methods. Instead critically evaluate those methods you are likely to use. \r\nâ€¢	Do not include lots of incidental, trivial detail about how you would actually carry out the research.  \r\nWhat makes for a good research proposal  \r\nThere are many ways to write a project proposal report, and we have no particular model answer in mind. The following are some of the points we are looking for: \r\nâ€¢	You must have a problem which you can analyse, define and for which you can devise feasible research questions. \r\nâ€¢	You should explain the main issues in your chosen topic and their wider academic and practical relevance. \r\nâ€¢	When reviewing the literature, you should communicate an awareness of the quality of the evidence on which an author draws and of the methodological issues posed by the way in which that evidence has been gathered. \r\nâ€¢	You should give a sense of how the literature has developed and identify the main themes of schools of thought in the literature. How do later articles and contributions in books build on the earlier results findings, and ideas in the literature? \r\nâ€¢	Most importantly, you should be critical and evaluative.  Do not just describe the literature you survey, explain why the authors have arrived at the conclusions they have. State whether you consider the authors have achieved their aims. Explain any weaknesses you feel there are in specific articles or books and, if possible, how those weaknesses could have been overcome. It is better to evaluate critically fewer references rather than cite many references with little critical appraisal. \r\nâ€¢	You should indicate the wider significance of your study â€“ what are the wider implications of what you have found both for the academic literature (whose approaches/viewpoints/hypotheses do your findings support?) and for practice (e.g. should people in organizations do things differently as a result?). \r\nâ€¢	Observe the usual requirements for a good presentation â€“ be grammatical, use punctuation marks correctly, try to avoid jargon etc. You should use headings and sub-headings to organise your material. \r\n \r\nFormal Requirements\r\nThe report should be no more than 3000 words in length (excluding the bibliography), with a 10% upper limit and should be organised as indicated above. \r\n The report should be double-spaced, well presented and structured. Appendices should only be used when judged to be strictly necessary to understand the project. The work should use the Harvard system of references, and all references should be included in a properly presented bibliography.  \r\n', 'MSc Management', 'Masters', '[\"Research Paper\"]', '[\"Human Resource Management\"]', '2023-04-28 15:00', '6500', 'Assessment BUSM145.docx_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Instructions and guidance\r\n           The aim of the proposal\r\nThe research proposal requires you to demonstrate your ability to identify, analyse a research problem related to business and management, and to set out a plan for a research project to investigate that problem. The aim of this assessment is to enable you to develop and demonstrate your ability to: (a) diagnose a problem in business and management, (b) arrive at the consequent research questions, (c) determine how to answer these questions by drawing on the academic literature, (d) assess the potential of different research methods and (e) plan a small-scale research project.  \r\nYour report is intended to form the plan for how you might use the literature (by drawing on the ideas and findings of others), design a research project and analyse the findings.  \r\nThis report is among the most challenging assignments set during the M.Sc. programmes. You are being asked to anticipate the issues that will confront you in conducting a small research project. Thus, it is quite different from and more difficult than, writing a conventional coursework paper. The best reports are usually those produced by those students who have devoted considerable thought to the assignment before even beginning to write the report.  \r\nYour choice of problem for the project proposal report does not commit you to that topic for your dissertation. You can just complete the report as a free-standing exercise in which you are assessed on your ability to analyse a problem, grasp the arguments and the evidence contained in the literature and devise a suitable research design. You are free to select a different topic for your dissertation if you so wish, although there are obvious advantages in sticking to a topic to which you have already given thought and invested some work (although you must avoid cutting and-pasting parts of the proposal into the dissertation).  \r\n\r\n \r\n        The Research Proposal requirements\r\n        The report must include the following main elements: \r\n1.	Title. This can include a subtitle and should indicate what the research is essentially about. \r\n2.	Abstract. The abstract sums up the research problem/questions, research design and methods, and relation to the literature and/or practice. \r\n3.	Introduction in the form of an analysis of the problem to be addressed. This introductory material should include a clear statement of the problem, the question(s) to be researched, the importance of those questions and an indication of the potential role of business and management theories in answering the questions. The introduction should have clear labelling of the aim and objectives. \r\n4.	A summary critical review of the relevant literature, both theoretical and applied. This section should indicate what can be learnt from the current literature and will seek to identify some of the strengths and weaknesses of that literature. You are not expected to provide a comprehensive guide to the literature, but you are expected to communicate an understanding of some of the main theoretical ideas and presently available evidence relating to your topic. You must refer to the academic literature and not just to the professional literature (note that the former usually involves seeking an in-depth and critical understanding of problems while the latter is usually restricted to matters of \'how-to-do-it\'). \r\n5.	An outline of the proposed research design and methods. You should outline the research design and the likely methods, taking care to point to the strengths and weaknesses of your proposed research methods. You must outline a research project that can feasibly be done within the constraints of the M.Sc. dissertation process, indicate that you have good reason to believe that the necessary data is available and can be collected, that your choice of method(s) is appropriate and likely to produce reliable and valid results, and that you have considered any ethical questions raised by the research. \r\n6.	Conclusion. The conclusion summarizes the problem, the purposes of the study, the research question/s, and the methodology. It should also acknowledge any possible limitations of the approach \r\n(e.g. any problems of generalizability from limited number of cases). \r\n7.	Documentation: Appendix, references, and general presentation of the work. Using the Harvard approach to referencing and the references are done correctly in alphabetic order. You may include an appendix for any additional material you consider relevant, however the appendix will not be assessed. Diagrams and tables should be numbered, captioned, and presented correctly. \r\n\r\nTo pass the assignment, you must include all these key elements. However, you do not have to devote an equal number of words to each of them. In particular, the analysis of the problem is very likely to be shorter than the other elements. \r\nWhat you should NOT do (these reflect the failings of past research proposals)\r\nâ€¢	Do not write an essay about a general topic.  \r\nâ€¢	Do not just describe the application of a particular management technique or method (e.g. TQM, a project management technique), you must analyse the underlying problem and critically evaluate the alternative \'solutions\'. \r\nâ€¢	Do not write a literature review that is solely or largely dependent on pop management books or the professional rather than the academic literature. \r\nâ€¢	Do not write a literature review in the form of an annotated bibliography. \r\nâ€¢	Do not write a general essay on research methods. Instead critically evaluate those methods you are likely to use. \r\nâ€¢	Do not include lots of incidental, trivial detail about how you would actually carry out the research.  \r\nFormal Requirements\r\nThe report should be no more than 3000 words in length (excluding the bibliography), with a 10% upper limit and should be organised as indicated above. \r\n The report should be double-spaced, well presented and structured. Appendices should only be used when judged to be strictly necessary to understand the project. The work should use the Harvard system of references, and all references should be included in a properly presented bibliography.  \r\nSUBMISSION FORMAT:\r\nPlease observe the following style guide. \r\nâ€¢ All work must be typed and submitted in MS Word or Adobe PDF format \r\nâ€¢ Font size should be 12 point (unless otherwise specified) \r\nâ€¢ Font style should be Arial \r\nâ€¢ Lines should be double-spaced \r\nâ€¢ Leave margins for comment \r\nInsert page numbers \r\nâ€¢ Use a header containing your student ID number, the module code to which your work applies, and \r\nthe date. And Please:\r\nâ€¢ Always spell-check and proof read your work before handing it in (once you have submitted your \r\nwork you will not be permitted to retrieve it) \r\nâ€¢	Keep your own electronic back-up copy of your work and if possible save on two devices \r\nâ€¢	Avoid plagiarism \r\nâ€¢	Submit your work on time\r\n\r\n \r\n', 'Msc Entrepreneurship and Innovation', 'Masters', '[\"Research Paper\"]', '[\"Global business environment\"]', '2023-04-30 15:00', '6000', 'Assessment BUSM145.docx_$_', '2023-05-22 18:42:19', '', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

You are expected to develop a suitable and realistic research proposal, with a view to\r\nundertaking a focused piece of contemporary research with clear and tangible outcomes of interest and relevance to the work context. The\r\ntopic that you choose to study for your research is your own choice but should relate to business and management disciplines, and in particular\r\nto your specific Master programme subject. For example, if you\'re studying the MSc International Business & Marketing Management, your\r\ndissertation should focus on a marketing topic, such as digital marketing, media and advertising, brand management, etc. You will need to\r\ndecide on the area of research for your Research Proposal fairly quickly â€“ in just a few weeks.\r\nIdeally, your Research Proposal should be something novel that will have practical value to businesses or other organisations. It should have a\r\ntheoretical perspective as well as a practical purpose. One idea is to take a favourite management area (e.g., marketing) and an area of\r\npersonal interest (e.g., SMEs in the hospitality sector) and then develop a project into e.g., the marketing of SMEs in the hospitality sector.\r\nAlternatively, look for something topical in the news that has a business perspective. Some students use the project to develop their knowledge\r\nof an area within which they hope to develop a career. The lectures, seminars and your reading will help you to decide on your topic and the\r\nbest research approach to use. However, if you are really struggling, we are available to give advice.\r\nResearch Proposal Structure\r\nThe following information is a general overview of the structure and contents of a Research Proposal and additionally summarises what should\r\nbe demonstrated by the proposal and by you as a researcher. This is not a definitive structure, only a guideline that covers all the important\r\nareas in a logical manner. There is flexibility to adjust or change this structure depending on your individual needs. The following elements may\r\nform subheadings for your research proposal document. The numbers in brackets are a guide of how many words are required for each section.\r\nHowever, they are only a guide and not definitive.\r\nWorking title (maximum 12 words)\r\nThis should capture the essence of your project, and includes information which relates to the proposed study which you wish to undertake.\r\nIntroduction (approximately 300 words)\r\nâ— What are you exploring and why?\r\nâ— Put the research into context.\r\nâ— Why is it important to study this topic (rationale)?\r\n1\r\nâ— Clearly identify your research question/problem.\r\nâ— What are the specific aims and objectives of the research?\r\nLiterature review (approximately 700 words)\r\nThis section should identify and critically review the key literature that has been written on your topic. It should compare and contrast\r\nperspectives that have been gleaned from reading and investigating the subject. While this might come from textbooks, journal articles and\r\nother reports, journal articles will be your main source. The review might also include more practitioner-based studies which are of\r\nsignificance. Remember, it is important to look for themes in the literature, not just describe one article after another. Make sure you reference\r\neverything clearly and be careful not to plagiarise. Also, make sure you clearly show the importance of the literature you are writing about to\r\nyour topic. DO NOT just put slabs of unrelated literature in your literature review. Please show the reader why it is in there. What does it mean\r\nto your project?\r\nMethodology (approximately 900 words)\r\nProvide a clear and justified statement of your proposed research approach to address your research question/aim. You should provide a clear\r\nrationale for your choice of method(s), with a clear link to your research question/aim. You should also include a critical evaluation of the\r\nstrengths and limitations of your proposed approach. This section could include: (a) data collection method(s) to be used with justifications, (b)\r\nparticipants where appropriate (population, sample size, access), (c) ethical considerations and potential limitations and ways to overcome\r\nthem, (d) research philosophy which will underpin the dissertation if relevant.\r\nA feasible and detailed Action Plan (approximately 100 words)\r\nAssume you will be implementing your project plan during June-January, provide a realistic, detailed and practical action plan. You should\r\nprovide a graphical form, for example, a Gantt chart, including key milestones of your research against specific dates, i.e. research schedule\r\nshowing the target completion date for each task or activity (review of literature, data collection, data analysis, write-up, first draft to your\r\nsupervisor, etc.). You could also include the resources needed to undertake the proposed research.\r\n2\r\nReferences (excluded from word count, minimum 20 references)\r\nCreate a Reference List of only the sources you have cited in the body of your proposal. Please do not include anything that is not in the body of\r\nyour proposal. In-text citations and the reference list should use the Harvard style. Appropriate referencing is important to avoid plagiarism so\r\nplease take this seriously.

The UK economy will be the starting point and you should also discuss the markets in \nwhich the company operates. Then, narrowing down to the industry where the company operates, it is \nexpected to briefly review and discuss the industry. Lastly, it is expected to introduce the company and frame \nand discuss the research question of this project. \n\n\nChapter 2 â€“ Financial Performance and Position of the Company (guideline: 30% of total word count)\nIn the analysis of the financial performance and position of the company it is anticipated that various ratios \nshould be calculated to enable the profitability, liquidity, asset management and capital structure of the \ncompany to be described and analysed. By carefully reading the various statements and analyses that are \nincluded in the Annual Report, it should be possible to produce a view of the company, its performance, \nstrategy, and trends over the past five years. In this analysis, the ratios of the target company should be \ncompared with those of 3 to 5 peer companies. These peer companies will act as benchmarks for the \ncompanyâ€™s position and performance, so their selection criteria should be first set and discussed. It is \nimportant to provide a good justification of the peer group selection and outline clearly the associated \nselection criteria. Then, the ratios of the peer companies should be also calculated over the past five years \nto make comparisons across years and across companies.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 - Valuation of the company (guideline: 30% of total word count)\nThere are a number of different approaches that can be employed to estimate the value of a company. Some \nare relatively easy to implement but lack a strong theoretical basis, whereas others, such as those based on \nthe discounted cash flow approach, have a strong theoretical basis but are more difficult to implement. The \ndifferent approaches will almost certainly produce different values that may be difficult to reconcile, but may \nalso provide different insights into the factors determining the value of the company.

Develop conclusions from your evaluation. Use these conclusions to develop a â€˜future imaginationâ€™ of how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\nYour evaluation must include a critical appraisal of self-identity theory to inform your arguments. Additionally you must include evidence of relevant changing consumption behaviours and predictions from relevant experts. You must develop your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ from your conclusions. \nIn addressing the above question, you are advised to make the following choices:\nChoose a specific consumer segment who engage in a specific consumption behaviour occurring in response to a societal challenge. You can phrase this as a problem or opportunity. Here are some suggestions to help you to develop your own ideas. You do not need to choose from any of them. You can chose any combination that addresses the assignment question. Please ask your tutor if you are unsure:\nClimate change and sustainable development, e.g. eco-tourists and climate change, millennials and consumption reduction, activists and anti-consumption. \nThe increasing interest in health and fitness is another potential area, including shifts that have occurred from the Covid-19 pandemic. Examples include a shift from in-person to online fitness classes. Growth in wearable health technology. Increasing membership of online health and wellbeing platforms.\nAdvances and benefits of artificial intelligence in consumption choices. Examples include using an AIÂ chatbot for a health care consultation. AI in agriculture (intelligent farming) to increase food availability/nutrition to mitigate food poverty and migration. AI designed to inform consumerâ€™s decision-making (e.g. online shopping â€“ getting purchasing right first time to prevent waste). Developing positive body image chatbots to promote a healthy body image among younger consumers.\nShifts in dietary choices. For example, in response to food/water insecurity, biodiversity, and animal welfare considerations, as well as advances in food science and technology. This has supported shifts to â€˜different lifestylesâ€™ and created opportunities for food innovation development and lifestyles including vegan, flexitarian, anti-meat, artificial food e.g. lab-made â€˜meatâ€™.\nEconomic constraints are also triggering CB changes, e.g. frugal consumption connected with growing poverty, consuming from â€˜foodbanksâ€™ and â€˜community fridgesâ€™. Sharing/leasing not buying, pre-owned/recycled/ repurposed are also an outcome of this, as well for ecological reasons (positive or negative depending on perspectives). \nFocus on one consumer segment pertinent to your topic and country/sector choice. You should develop a profile of this segment, providing as much pertinent information as you can, e.g. using sociodemographics, psychographics. Please present visually or in table format, fully referenced.\nFocus on one country for your essay. Having this focus will make it a lot easier for you to identify and evaluate the evidence within the word limit specified.\nWhile you are required to use self-identity theory for your essay, you MUST focus on a specific concept, model or framework within it. For example, the self-concept model, social-self, pro-environmental self-identity, pro-social self-identity, body image, etc. Choose ONE of these. Do NOT include multiple identity frameworks/ models in your essay because this will undermine the depth of analysis you can achieve within the 3000 word count limit.\n\nOnce you make the above choices, you are required to investigate research evidence from academic articles, news from legitimate sources, industry reports etc. to critically analyse how consumer behaviour has changed in response to the societal issue you have identified. Building from this appraisal, you will explain, evaluate and apply your identity framework/model to your chosen issue. This will enable you to develop evidence-based analytical conclusions, from which you can create your future imagination.\nDo not forget the marker feedback in making your revisions.\n\nGuidelines (identical to first submission)\nYou should draw on a good range of high quality academic and expert opinion sources to construct solid arguments for your paper. You should use relevant examples and data to support your claims. Ensure you fully reference all sources of information.\nYou are required to write a critique of transforming/transformed consumer behaviour, informed by contextual information, evidence and relevant theory. Your critique will involve you assessing varied data, ideas and scholarship from varied sources. Be adventurous in your searching but note the advice given to you on reputable sources. \nYou must focus on one framework/model of identity theory in your essay. This will really help you to develop a stronger critical appraisal to show your understanding and critical thinking. \nYou must choose only one country and one consumer segment. Within this country and segment, try to analyse your chosen CB transformation broadly and briefly. Then narrow down again to your chosen sector/industry/segment and again articulate this transformation. You now have an explanation that is country, sector and consumer specific. Now that you have this foundation, you can begin to build your academic arguments by integrating your chosen identity theory. Continuously, apply and evaluate your theory to your country/sector/segment otherwise your context and theory risk being disconnected. Lastly, extrapolate your conclusions to a 5-10 year future in order to imagine how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. \nYou must ensure the evidence you use to compile your paper relates to your choices (i.e. do not use American evidence to discuss China!). Preliminary reading will help you to make your choices. Whatever you choose to do, ensure you present your argument for your choices at the start of your paper â€“ and justify them. \nAssemble the evidence for your arguments, avoid unsubstantiated statements and bias - this is an objective investigation. It is essential that you critique your chosen theory and evidence, do not just describe it; evaluate the contribution it makes to our understanding of transforming/transformed consumer behaviour and how marketing to consumers (as customers or event participants) will evolve as a result in the future.\nNot sure what to choose? Maybe this article will help: Rust, Roland T. (2020). The future of Marketing, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 37(1), 15-26. \nTo help develop your ideas and your â€˜future imaginationâ€™, refer to the academic articles published in â€œFuturesâ€ in the suggested readings at the end of this assignment briefing. This is a starting point, please source others relevant to your chosen topic.\nTo see an example of an imaginative future go to Dermody, J., Koenig-Lewis, N., Zhao, A. L., & Hanmer-Lloyd, S. (2021). Critiquing a Utopian Idea of Sustainable Consumption: A Post-Capitalism Perspective.Â Journal of Macromarketing,Â 41(4), 626â€“645.Â https://doi.org/10.1177/0276146720979148 \nFurther readings are added to Moodle, as appropriate. Please also refer to the readings attached to each topic, as these may also be relevant for your essay.\n\nPresenting coursework for assessment\nYour assignment when submitted should not include your name â€“ we use a system of anonymous marking to reduce the risk of any unconscious bias. For some authentic assessments, there may be an exception to this, so please confirm with your Module Leader.\nWe suggest the following format for your essay, which mimics the marking criteria listed in the table below, Please discuss with your seminar leader if you wish to depart from this structure: \nPart 1: Introduction and Explanation (500-800 words): Introduce and examine your societal challenge, consumer segment and behaviour and country. Explain the issue clearly and its impact, citing supporting evidence and justify why it is worthy of exploration in your essay. Include a profile of your chosen consumer segment.\nPart 2: Evaluation and application of theoretical framework (1500-1800 words): Begin by giving an overview of identity theory, then focus on your chosen identity framework/model. Explain it and apply it to you challenge and context in part 1. Evaluate its contribution in explaining the CB transformation that is occurring, using scholarly research and evidence to support your arguments. Use examples throughout, pertinent to your focus. Images and illustrations can be used and add value to written arguments. \nPart 3: Conclusions (300-500 words): Develop conclusions based on your content in parts 1 and 2. Do not simply summarise your essay (this is not a conclusion). Your conclusions should be insightful and analytical and lead into your future appraisal. They should also demonstrate your learning from critically reviewing your chosen context and identity theory. Developing a â€˜visual mapâ€™ to illustrate this can be a useful communication tool; this is entirely up to you. Examples are discussed in the assignment briefings and clinics. Keep your writing style concise and focused. Numbering each conclusion will be helpful for cross referencing with your future appraisal. You could also consider these as a map for part 4.\nPart 4: The future (<500 words): This is where you get to be creative! Tell us, based on your analysis in part 1,2 and 3 your core ideas for imagining how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. Include specific examples of your chosen issue/segment/behaviour. You can present your â€˜future imaginationâ€™ as text and visually (we are not expecting artwork from you). Visualisation is encouraged and can include multiple formats, e.g. drawing, photographs, and digital images. Infographics are useful, using free software that is readily available. Check permissions for using any images that are not your own (and reference them as instructed by the owners).   \nMake sure your discussion of the future is connected and builds upon what you have stated in the body of your essay and is backed by evidence.\nPlease note: \nParts 1 and 2 need to be fully and extensively referenced. \nPart 3 will contain some pertinent references to support your insight e.g. from futurism, but should not repeat the full range of references in your theory review. Remember conclusions represent your critical thinking built from your prior analysis which you have already referenced. \nPart 4 does not require references, albeit you may need to reference some futurism insights if you include them here instead of in your conclusion (either place is fine). This section is showcasing your critical and creative thinking.\nThe use of subheadings to break up the essay is OK, however, please ensure you donâ€™t have too many as you risk hyper-fragmenting your essay, which may hamper the flow of discussion and subsequent analysis.\nSuggested Formatting:\nPlease provide a title page giving the title of your essay specifying your focus (necessary).\nPlease use 1.5 spacing, and insert an extra line between paragraphs. This helps the marker to insert their feedback.\nFont size 11 or 12 is preferable using Calibri, Arial, Courier or similar (do not use a mix of font types). This helps the marker with eye fatigue when they are reading multiple papers. You will also find it easier to proof-read your work, and spot errors for correction.\nEmbolden headings and subheadings. Make main and sub headings distinctive, e,g  capitals for main headings, or italics for subheadings, or underlining (choose which) and be consistent. You can also use a numbering system, e.g. 1, then 1.1. This makes it easier for you to present the logic of your arguments. It is also useful for you to check you have fully answered all parts of the essay brief. \nPlease do not use any kind of framing in your page layout as this restricts marker comments.\nUse the normal setting for page layout specified in word.\nPlease use visuals â€“ we really like to see these. We are not expecting professional graphics. They are so useful in enabling you to synthesise your thoughts from the evidence and theory you have evaluated, and then present this to us in a very succinct way. This is a great skill to carry forward.\n\n\n\nAssignment length/equivalent\nWhilst we acknowledge that learners will prepare and produce assessments in different ways and at different paces, an indication as to how much time it will take you to prepare, produce, edit and submit this assessment is detailed below.\nThe maximum word count for this assignment is 3000 words (excluding references and appendices). The minimum word count is 2800 words. We advise students to use the maximum word allowance in developing their essay.\nIt will take approximately 74 hours for students to complete this assignment. \n', 'MSc Marketing communications management ', 'Masters', '[\"Report Writing\",\"Literature Review\",\"Research Paper\",\"Primary/Secondary Data Analysis\",\"Review Article\",\"Thesis Writing\",\"Case Studies\"]', '[\"Marketing Communication\",\"Academic research\",\"masters\",\"undersatnding consumer beahviour\",\"Management\"]', '2023-07-05 12:00', '5400', '5097MARK 7013 Resit Brief June 2023.docx_$_', '23-06-2023 06:02:44', '', '16', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This must have been the reason why within the space of just a few weeks OBBC has been approached by several organisations to pitch for a brand positioning project.\nOBBC is a new and small brand management consultancy consisting of a group of lecturers and practitioners from various marketing disciplines. Since they donâ€™t have the capacity to work on several pitches at the same time, they urgently need your help.\nThe OBBC team knows that in terms of its capacity it could only work for one more client in 2023. However, the OBBC team is not sure which of the brand positioning projects they should pitch for. This is where you come in. They decide to hire up-and-coming brand management experts on a freelance basis. So, they ask you to look at a request from the Indian Institute of Millets Research, a premier agricultural research institute engaged in basic and strategic research on sorghum and other millets. One of their current projects focuses on supporting small millets farm cooperatives throughout India with a common Brand Positioning to take up export opportunities to Europe.\nThe millets farm cooperatives have been able to bridge the urban-rural divide, increase women participation, educate the farmers, skill rural youth and spread digital solutions and facilities throughout India. Agricultural marketing cooperatives are cooperative businesses owned by farmers, to undertake transformation, packaging, distribution, and marketing of farm products (both crop and livestock.)\nOne of the focus areas of millet cooperatives is alternative farming for food security. They support women, children, and elders in deprived communities to secure semi-arid land for farming traditional millet grains. Millet is a broad term that covers many varieties of traditional grains. It is nutritious, drought-resistant, and easier to grow in the regions with little access to irrigation water. These grains were playing a very important role in sustaining health in the deprived communities. As the next step the collective is supporting their farmers to directly market and sale part of their harvest as cash crops, for domestic and export consumers.\nTheir aim is to enter the market with a competitive advantage by acknowledging the important â€˜zeitgeistâ€™ trends. For example the the United Nations has proclaimed 2023 as the International Year of Millets (IYM).\nTherefore, OBBC is pitching now to help farm cooperatives prepare for a future brand positioning that takes latest broader societal trends as well as a comprehensive market analysis into account. Due to time constraints, OBBC decides for the initial pitch phase to focus geographically on the UK market only. For more details, see\nhttps://www.millets.res.in/index.php, https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1744497\nOne of the key challenges is to attract younger target audiences.\n   \nFaculty of Business, Oxford Brookes University 5\n  Your report needs to cover the following elements.\nâ€¢ ANALYSIS: Many brands (Jalpur, TRS, Manna) market and supply Millet products. Based on research on the other brands, a brand needs to be created. What is your brand about? What are the key meanings, manifestations, and stakeholders of your brand? What does the current competitorâ€™s â€˜productâ€™ portfolio look like? Based on your analysis of the client (small millets farm cooperatives) what can be the brandâ€™s vision, mission, and core values? What are the potential strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats? What are the possible positioning ideas based on the competitors and extended? Your analysis is expected to look at a variety of elements of the brand.\nThis should include the brandâ€™s IDEOLOGY, CAPABILITIES, CONSUMERS/STAKEHOLDERS, COMPETITION and ENVIRONMENT. Mark allocation: 30%\nâ€¢ STRATEGY: Based on your analysis, you are expected to create a brand and discuss two different potential positioning options for the brand which could be established in the UK market in spring/summer 2025. You then need to justify/evaluate which of the discussed positionings has the most potential, i.e. you need to choose one positioning option and justify your decision. You can extend a competitorâ€™s positioning strategy that already exists, but you need to justify why this is the best option. Finally, you are expected to make suggestions as to how the brand positioning idea could be transformed into strategic frameworks that can be used to brief the clientâ€™s marketing team who need to bring this positioning idea to life. In this context you must apply one or more of the following frameworks: (a) SBM Vision, Mission & Values; (b) SBM Brand Pyramid; and/or (c) Transformation Grid.\nMark allocation: 30%\nâ€¢ IMPLEMENTATION: Based on your strategic framework(s), you need to develop and explain implementation activities to show how, for example, the clientâ€™s UK marketing team could implement the core strategic idea which you have developed\n \nFaculty of Business, Oxford Brookes University 6\n with different specific stakeholders. This needs to contain an activity in terms of cocreative new product development. One implementation activity needs to utilise social media-based communications or other latest digital technology.\nMark allocation: 30%\nMore guidance will be given during the lectures and seminars therefore attendance throughout the semester is critical.\nThe remaining 10% are allocated for the quality of the presentation of the assignment. This means, for example, overall presentation style; standard of English; breadth, depth, and quality of sources; references list presented in Harvard Referencing Style; word count well used.\nYou are required to produce a report comprising the three key areas outlined above. You must support your decisions with academic references as well as other secondary sources. Therefore, you must search for and use relevant information on the brand, but you are NOT expected to conduct primary empirical research as part of the assignment.\nIMPORTANT\nYou are NOT allowed to contact either the Indian Institute of Millets Research, the farm cooperatives or any of their competitors directly. All inquiries must go via the module leader. Breaking this rule may lead to a referral to the academic conduct officer and might lead to a deduction of marks. Furthermore, you are required to keep this live client project completely confidential. None of the client-related information provided during the course of this module should be shared with anybody else who is not enrolled on this module. Additionally, you should not share any of the ideas you develop for this work with anybody else.\nYour report should include a short introduction and conclusion and in the three main sections you need to apply relevant theory, tools and frameworks discussed in the lectures and seminars as well as the recommended core literature you have read. In this context, you are expected to use some of the key ideas of at least eight of the sources listed in the libraryâ€™s current reading list for MARK7010 within your work.\nRefer to the Individual Coursework Feedback Sheet below for more details about the marking criteria. Please make sure that you have read the criteria thoroughly before you submit your assignment.\nAssessment criteria\nPlease see the assessment grid at the back of this Coursework Brief for full details.\nPresenting coursework for assessment\nYour assignment when submitted should not include your name â€“ we use a system of anonymous marking to reduce the risk of any unconscious bias.

We therefore require you to complete your assignments within the maximum number of 3500 words specified in the assignment brief.\nThe specified word count refers to the main body of the report and does not include front cover, title page, contents page, reference list, or appendices. The word count does include headings, tables and in-text citations, but not equations or diagrams.\nAppendices should be used to provide supporting evidence only and will not be marked. Furthermore, appendices are limited to 3 pages (6 sides) and inappropriate use of appendices will be taken into consideration when awarding the final mark.\nAn executive summary is NOT required.\nPlease also remember that a report can be enhanced or damaged through layout, for example, placing all tables and diagrams in appendices can hamper the flow of discussion.

For example, in relation to interpersonal relationships, we discussed whether humans are socially constructed to be attracted to young women and wealthy men or whether this is rooted in our biology. Choose one such topic and present evidence for each of the perspectives. Conclude by providing your own insights into the debate.\n\nExample papers:\nKrebs (2008) \"Morality: An Evolutionary Account\"\nFehr and Fischbacher (2003) \"The nature of human altruism\"\n\n(2) With respect to group identity theories, discuss what strategies and conditions can facilitate or undermine human prosociality.\nWhen we learnt about altruism, we discussed factors that influence its occurrence. We also discussed ways in which prejudice can be reduced. Present three strategies or conditions, derived from the literature on the biological basis of cooperation or social determinates of it, that are known to influence rates of cooperation. At least one of these strategies should concern Social Identity, and the role group membership plays in cooperation between individuals.\n\nExample papers:\nFehr and Schurtenberger (2018) \"Normative foundations of human cooperation\"\nPettigrew and Tropp (2006) \"A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory\"\nCikara et al., (2014) \"Their pain gives us pleasure - How intergroup dynamics shape empathic failures and counter-empathic responses\"\n\n(3) Summarise the person-situation debate and present three examples where situational attributes affect social behaviour from various topics in the module. Present your own view of the debate with reference to research and theory.\nThe person-situation debate concerns the role personal, dispositional characteristics have in determining behaviour as opposed to contextual, situational attributes. First, present the debate in reference to the literature. Then, provide examples of situational influence relating to the topics we covered in the module (e.g., situations that influence altruism, attraction, etc.). Conclude by presenting your own insights into the debate.\n\nExample papers:\nSherman et al., (2015) \"The Independent Effects of Personality and Situations on Real-time Expressions of Behavior and Emotion\"\nThielmann et al., (2020) \"Personality and prosocial behavior: A theoretical framework and meta-analysis\"\n\n(4)  Discuss the methodological importance of including non-WEIRD samples in social psychological research.\nIn the first lecture, we discussed the problematic use of WEIRD samples in social psychology. Then, throughout the term, we brought up examples of social behaviours and attitudes that vary across cultures. In your answer, present the concept of WEIRD samples, and provide evidence for their prevailing use in social psychological research as well as research using other kinds of samples.

Suggesting Flipkart and JioMart uses similar policies for returning of parcels as part of their last mile deliveries.\r\n\r\nResearch Design: In the present study, it is proposed to follow an exploratory research methodology incorporating quantitative research approach. The present study proposes to conduct a survey with help of a self-reported questionnaire. The data collected through the survey will be subjected to quantitative analysis which will aim on highlighting the difference in efficiency of Last Mile Delivery Techniques between Flipkart and JioMart in India. \r\nData Collection: The present study proposes to collect primary data by administration of self-reported questionnaire. The study would primarily focus on quantitative data that will help in determining whether there is a difference in the efficiency of Last Mile Delivery Techniques of Flipkart and JioMart.\r\nSample and Sampling: The present study proposes to perform purposive sampling for selecting of total 100 participants. Employees working in different departments of both companies Flipkart (n= 50) and JioMart (n=50) will be enrolled in the study to determine their perception for their respective companies performance of last mile delivery services.\r\nVariables: Five key indicators of last mile delivery services are to be studied in the current research. The effectiveness of last mile delivery services of two companiesâ€™: Flipkart and JioMart will be compared on basis of employeesâ€™ perception on the following five key indicators; perceived ease of use, delivery time and conditions, acceptance of delivery methods, tracking of parcels, and returns of parcels.\r\n\r\nPreliminary Literature Gap\r\nQuality of deliveries heavily impacts the success of e-commerce businesses that aim to attract audiences for enlarging their consumer base; this is a pertinent point why user experience is a key component of last mile delivery services around the world (Vrhovac, et al., 2023). However, the techniques used by different e-commerce giants to gain advantage in delivery strategies are still an unexplored area in Indian market. Companies such as Flipkart, Amazon, Jio, have revolutionized online shopping in India and their strategies for deliveries have gained much popularity especially after the pandemic (Sudhakar, & Syed, 2016). \r\nAccording to a research conducted by Kalakata, Anand, and Saxena (2022) Flipkart like most companies had to face tremendous of challenges during pandemic, where nationwide lockdowns made it difficult for Flipkart last mile delivery partner eKart to deliver goods to consumers with closing down of their warehouses, however, the findings of research suggests that Flipkart employees believe that changes in companyâ€™s logistics for last mile delivery and attempt at technology innovations in their delivery system helped the company overcome the challenges. Nevertheless, there is still less knowledge of how deep the impact of last mile delivery services of Flipkart has on consumers.\r\nMoreover, many scholars have addressed aspects such as online retailing, consumer satisfaction, inventory and logistics management and even e-facilities, yet a lot is unknown about the delivery system, including Last Mile Delivery System of recent times (Sharma, Prakash, & Singh, 2022). \r\nSimilar gap in literature was found for JioMart, a company that uses different ways to fulfil their last mile deliveries. JioMart make use of small local vendors as their virtual storefronts, and offer its consumers various modes of payments and deliveries to choose from that impact their overall business (Reardon, et al., 2021). However, there is a persistent gap in how e-commerce businesses such as JioMart conduct their delivery fulfilment in Asia (Reardon, et al., 2021). \r', NULL, 'Masters', '[\"Dissertation Writing\"]', NULL, '2023-08-31 00:00', '28800', '', '03-08-2023 21:14:18', 'team_member_1', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Non-durable products like packaged foods, drinks, toiletries, over-the-counter medicines, and other consumables are examples. The FMCG sector is a cornerstone of the UK economy, making a sizeable contribution to annual GDP and providing thousands of jobs across the country.\r\nEffective demand forecasting, or the prediction of future product demand, is one of the key components of success in this industry. Because it enables FMCG companies to optimize their production and supply chains, lower storage expenses, cut waste, and ultimately boost profitability, accurate demand forecasting is essential. Accurate forecasting is difficult due to the wide range of unpredictable factors that affect the demand for FMCGs, including changes in consumer behavior, shifting economic conditions, and emerging trends. As a result, there is an increasing need to research and pinpoint the best demand forecasting techniques that can boost the effectiveness of the FMCG sector in the UK. In addition, despite the strategic significance of demand forecasting, extensive research that examines the various forecasting methodologies employed in the UK FMCG industry appears to be lacking. The industry \' s capacity to benchmark and adopt best practices may be hampered by this gap in the literature, which would reduce its efficiency and growth potential.\r\nTherefore, the goal of this study is to evaluate various demand forecasting methodologies in order to identify the most effective ones for the UK \' s FMCG industry. By taking into account the special context of the FMCG sector, it seeks to comprehend the benefits and limitations of each methodology and offer insightful information to both practitioners and academics.\r\nHR specialists from UK-based FMCG companies will also be included in our study. Most studies concentrate on supply chain managers or executives, so this is a novel approach. We think HR professionals can offer a wider organizational perspective on the choice-making process regarding the adoption of particular forecasting techniques because of their strategic role in these companies.\r\nMethodology\r\nTo help the UK \' s Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry, we analyze various demand forecasting methodologies in this study. A mixed-methods strategy integrating both qualitative and quantitative methodologies will be used to thoroughly understand and effectively address the research question.\r\nOur research \' s preliminary stage entails a thorough literature review. This will entail a thorough analysis of scholarly works, research reports, and trade publications that have concentrated on FMCG demand forecasting. We can comprehend the variety of forecasting techniques that have been applied in the past and comprehend the trends and factors influencing their success or failure by studying the literature. Setting specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, such as date of publication, relevance to the FMCG sector, and focus on the UK market, will be part of the methodology for carrying out this review. Next, we will list important databases and conduct a thorough search of each one using predetermined keywords. After locating the pertinent articles, we will analyze them to determine the most effective forecasting methods as demonstrated by the literature.\r\nThe second stage of our study focuses on gathering primary data, which entails interviewing HR specialists working in the UK \' s FMCG industry. The key informants for our study were HR professionals because they play a strategic role in these businesses and have valuable insights into organizational decision-making. We \' ll use both closed-ended and open-ended questions in our survey. Quantitative information on the usage and frequency of various forecasting techniques in the industry will be given by closed-ended questions. These will be simple-to-answer questions that will ease the burden on respondents and facilitate quick statistical analysis.\r\nOn the other hand, open-ended inquiries will enable us to delve deeper into the factors that led to the preference of one forecasting method over another. It will make it easier to comprehend why some businesses do not favor the technique that our literature review determined to be the \"best.\" We intend to use descriptive statistics and thematic analysis methods to analyze our survey data after it has been collected. To analyze quantitative data and identify any trends or commonalities in the application of forecasting methods, descriptive statistics will be used. On the other hand, thematic analysis of the qualitative responses will give detailed insights into the variables influencing the selection of forecasting methodologies in various FMCG companies. While our suggested methodology is thorough, it is also adaptable, taking into account that changes may be necessary as the research develops. The collection of data will be done ethically, protecting the privacy of participants and their personal information.\r\nIn the end, our research methodology will present a thorough understanding of demand forecasting in the UK FMCG sector. We aim to provide recommendations that can improve forecasting accuracy and thereby contribute to the industry \' s overall improvement by integrating insights from both the systematic literature review and primary data collection.\r\n\r\n', NULL, 'Masters', '[\"Dissertation Writing\"]', NULL, '2023-08-31 00:00', '30000', '', '03-08-2023 21:20:58', 'team_member_1', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

(1950, 1950, 'Academic Writing', 'Annotated Biblography', 'Length: 2000 words (+ or - 10%) - all inclusive. You are required to demonstrate an ability to keep within the word limit while still providing a comprehensive piece.\n\nBasic format (see further details below):\nFont and spacing: Size 12 font (Arial or Times New Roman) and 1.0 or 1.5 line spacing.\nUse APA 7th referencing style â€“ check iLearn for details.\n\nWhat is an annotated bibliography?\nAn annotated bibliography is generally based on a specific topic or question. You then source a list of references relevant to the topic or question and accompany each reference with a brief description and evaluation of it. This latter part reflects the  \' annotation \'  part of an annotated bibliography. \n\nAnnotated bibliographies have a very specific structure that must be followed - see the structure to be followed in this unit outlined below. \n\nPurpose and aim of this assessment\n\nThis annotated bibliography aims to:\nStrengthen your research skills and confidence in searching for quality sources of evidence, focused to a particular topic\nStrengthen your ability to succinctly summarise and evaluate the sources of evidence that you identify\nDeepen your knowledge on a particular topic covered in this unit\nSet you up for success in your remaining assessment pieces, as sourcing, evaluating, and integrating evidence is critical to all the work you will do at university and beyond!\n\nThe topic of our annotated bibliography \nYou must source articles on the following topic: \"What are the benefits and drawbacks of gig work, for the workers that do it?\"\n\nStructure and length of our annotated bibliography\n* To help you start your annotated bibliography, you can follow this template structure. *\n\nThis structure is adapted from Macquarie University \' s StudyWise site. Follow this link to see an example of an annotated bibliography and each of the 6 sections.\n\nFull reference - Begin with the full reference for the source you \' re annotating using the APA 7th referencing style.\nIntroduction - Your first sentences are your introduction. These should provide a broad overview of the topic of the text or a brief summary of the main arguments, ideas or findings presented by the author. \nMethod and Scope - Provide more detail about the method and scope of the research: What was being researched? How did the researcher(s) choose their subject or sample? How was the research undertaken? Did the researcher(s) decide to exclude anything or anyone from the study for a particular reason?\nFindings - Detail the findings of the research, analysis, or investigation.\nLimitations and Quality of the Reference - Explain any limitations you \' ve identified in the author \' s work. Include a statement/s reflecting on the quality of this reference. E.g., \"this source offered useful insights, but ...\"\nEvaluation of usefulness - Include a statement/s detailing the relevance and/or usefulness of this source to the topic - this is like a critical evaluation. Remember, not every source may inform the topic well, it may not offer a balanced argument, etc. Make those points here. E.g., \"overall this article only ..., it lacks ...\"\nSteps 5 and 6 are critical! This assessment is not just about describing each piece of research - you need to analyse and critically evaluate it too.\n\nEach annotation should be around 250-350 words in total. This means roughly a single paragraph. The length will obviously depend on the type of reference you are annotating - e.g., scholarly references are generally longer than other types of references, so their annotations may be at the upper bound of the suggested words.\n\nYou must include a minimum of three (3) scholarly references in your annotated bibliography - this includes sources like academic journal articles and book chapters. Outside of this requirement, you can incorporate more scholarly sources, as well as non-academic sources, such as websites or reports. However, you should be incorporating relevant and quality non-academic sources.\n\nOverall, you should aim to include around 5-7 references, and their annotations, in this assessment piece (exactly how many will depend on whether you are at the upper or lower bound of words for each annotation). DO NOT use references provided in the readings for the Gig Work topic - the aim is for you to undertake independent research on the focal topic.\n\nTo conclude your annotated bibliography, you must also include a concluding paragraph that briefly evaluates how well your entire collection of references informs the topic of the annotated bibliography. This should just be a short paragraph, roughly 150-200 words.\n\nHow to start \nLook at the topic for your annotated bibliography, start searching for relevant references, keeping in mind the guidance given above\nUse the Library \' s MultiSearch function or Google Scholar to particularly search for scholarly sources\nWider web searching can also direct you to other relevant and quality non-academic sources \nStart constructing your annotations, per the guidance above - don \' t forget there is a template to use up above!\nDon \' t forget your concluding paragraph! See guidance above.\n\n\nMOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ASSIGNMENT ARE :\n\nYou have used at least 3 scholarly sources (peer reviewed)\nYou have between 5-7 annotations PLUS a concluding paragraph\nYou \' ve followed the annotation structure\nYou \' ve used APA 7th referencing\nYou \' re within the word limit\nYou \' ve checked your Turnitin originality report and you \' re assuring us that what you submit is your work', NULL, 'Masters', '[\"Report Writing\"]', NULL, '2023-08-18 00:00', '3000', '2312Annotated bibliography template_6051-6008 (1).docx_$_2312reference-guide.pdf_$_', '09-08-2023 14:46:24', 'student', '16', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

By applying relevant theories and frameworks, we can better understand why the organisation is experiencing those things, which can involve looking at not just what is happening within the organisation, but also what is happening in its external environment.\n\nYou will be exposed to topics in this unit that organisations are almost always and universally grappling with â€“ motivating staff, job design, flexible work, etc. Analysing a case organisation through the lens of at least two topics in this unit will help you develop best practice insights into effective workforce management.\n\n\n\nPurpose and aim of this assessment\n\nThe case study report will build your skills in research, critical thinking and analysis, and generating insights (recommendations) based on assessing the workforce management practices of a targeted organisation.\nWhere will you ever use these skills? Everywhere!\n\nDeveloping these general skills, and being able to apply them to a specific area, is likely something youâ€™ll be asked to do throughout your working life.\n\nOur case study report structure\nThe case study has four sections. Use headings in your report to differentiate each section.\n\nBackground - briefly identify your focal organisation and the general situation/context of your case study.\nKey Issues - identify the major problems/issues/positives - there may well be lots of problems or issues that could be explored in your case. Or, your organisation could be managing its people very well, so a lot of positives could be explored in your case. Here, you need to identify and justify what you will be focusing on and why. For example, does the organisation have poor staff satisfaction and high turnover (problems), or flexible work practices and good working conditions (positives). Just aim to focus on 2-3 key issues.\nAnalysis - this is relevant theory application - discuss and apply theories/concepts/ frameworks from at least 2 topics in this unit to help analyse the issues/problems/positives that you have identified.\nRecommendations - here, identify possible solutions/recommendations - given your analysis, identify and justify recommendation/s on what you think should be done differently (or continue to be done) in your case organisation.\n\nHow to start\n\nYou will identify an organisation that is of interest to you AND for which you are able to examine, through research, its work-related management strategies, practices, processes and outcomes and be able to analyse and assess these in relation to at least two topics discussed in the unit. If you \' re unsure of appropriate topics or would like to discuss your choices, contact your teaching team.\n\n\nStep 1: Decide on a company\nIdentify a case study organisation â€“ you choose! Make sure itâ€™s one you can get information on.\nPointers:\n\nYour case organisation can be in any sector, be of any size, and operate anywhere in the world. To research this company you will need to use general web searching and other Library databases that we \' ll discuss in the support workshop for this assessment. You generally will not find information about your company and its issues in academic sources (you will use those sources to support your analysis and recommendations sections), so general web searching for the first two steps is fine. Maybe your case organisation is where you currently work. Using a range of sources to learn more about your chosen company is a good idea.\n\nStep 2: Identify key issues\nWhat are the workforce/people management challenges in this company? What are the good things they are doing? REMEMBER â€“ you can analyse what they do well, what they do not so well, or both. Again - use web searching to find this information. Are there news stories, reports, job review sites, etc that can give you insights into how the company manages its people?\nPointers:\n\nREMEMBER â€“ this isnâ€™t a marketing report, or a general strategy report, or a finance report. You must focus on issues relevant to this unit and relevant to the topics in this unit.\nDonâ€™t identify too many issues/positives to analyse! Two or three is fine â€“ too many means you have little time (or words) for meaningful and insightful analysis.\nStep 3: Start writing!\nStart writing into the case study report sections (see above), bring in your research through referencing.\nRemember, the main sections of your case study report are: Background; Key Issues; Analysis; Recommendations (detailed above); and finally you will have a Reference List (where you use APA 7th style to identify all the sources you have referenced in the text of your report).\nFor your background section - this can be brief. Just orient the reader to your company. This is descriptive only, analysis is where the marks are! You still need to reference in the text of your report here - show us where you are getting this information from, it might be websites, news stories, company reports, etc.\nFor your key issues section - donâ€™t identify too many issues/positives to analyse. Two to three is fine â€“ too many means you have no time for meaningful and insightful analysis. This section is also succinct - just identify your key issues and explain them for us. Again, you need to be citing references here - otherwise we do not know how you know these are issues the company has. Again, you will probably use similar sources to those you use in your Background section.\nFor your analysis section - this is where you apply theory from our unit to the key issues you \' ve identified. For example, if one of your issues is about poor staff retention because of poor pay, can you apply a motivation theory to explain why that might demotivate staff and encourage them to leave? Or, if one of your key issues is about the sorts of tasks people do, can you apply a job design theory? The analysis section is also where you will particularly reference scholarly material to explain and help apply your chosen theories to your key issues. REMEMBER - intext referencing looks this ... Smith et al. \' s (2021) study suggests that the allocation of repetitive tasks to workers leads to little variety in the use of their skills, which contradicts one aspect of Hackman and Oldham \' s (1976) job characteristics model. Focus your attention (and words) on the analysis section. This section touches on every criterion you are marked on â€“ research, analysis, etc (see the case study report marking rubric).\nFor your recommendations section - these need to be targeted, succinct and evidence-based. They also need to link to your analysis. Add sources of evidence (references) to support what youâ€™re suggesting. Remember â€“ you are evidence-based practitioners in this unit, donâ€™t suggest a course of action and offer no justification for it.\nOther pointers:\n\nResearch (and its integration into the report) is a critical part of this assessment piece, meaning referencing is required. You must undertake research independently and draw on academic source material and integrate it into your report. You need to use at least 5 scholarly references (these include academic books, book chapters, journal articles). Other non-academic source material, e.g. published reports, are also acceptable but should not form the majority of your references. You need to assess and demonstrate the quality of the material you cite â€“ do not just rely on news stories, blogs, general websites, etc.\nYou can use Ulrichsweb in the University Library site to check if a source is academic or not\n\n\nMOST IMPORTANT POINTS \nYou have used at least 5 scholarly sources\nYou have analysed your case using at least 2 topics from this unit\nYou \' ve followed the report structure\nYou \' ve used APA 7th referencing\nYou \' re within the word limit\nYou \' ve checked your Turnitin originality report and you \' re assuring us that what you submit is your work', NULL, 'Masters', '[\"Case Studies\"]', NULL, '2023-09-29 00:00', '3000', '', '18-09-2023 15:45:47', 'student', '16', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Of course, the disruption of the pandemic interrupted this progress, but in the year Apr â€™22 to Mar â€™23, numbers had returned to these pre-pandemic levels. [Note that published visitor numbers here include approx. 200,000 non-paying visits â€“ which reflects the Annual Pass ticket that Blenheim offer, allowing repeat visits over the year free of charge, which many local visitors choose to buy.] To help focus the Blenheim Palace marketing strategy, Palace visitors have been categorised into segments â€“ based on motivational characteristics. Regular visitor surveys provide data on the ratio of visitors in these segments (see Exhibit 1). In addition, web traffic analysis gives an insight into the geographical spread of all people purchasing tickets and consuming content on the www.blenheimpalace.com site (see Exhibit 2). Based on this study, it is also known that The Cotswolds â€“ the beautiful countryside within which the Palace is nestled â€“ attracts seven million day visits and 1.8 million staying visits annually. These holiday-makers and UK staycationers could represent one market segment that could be further developed.\n\n\n\nThe Adventure Play experience There are a number of fun things for families and children to enjoy at Blenheim Palace, and the Christmas Lights event is extremely popular. Nevertheless, from the visitor motivational analysis, it is estimated that families who visit for â€œFun for Childrenâ€ reasons represent only 5% of annual paying visitors, in the year Apr â€˜22 to Mar â€™23. To invest further in the appeal to this â€œFun for Childrenâ€ segment, and so grow the total number of paying visitors, The Adventure Play experience was opened in Apr â€™23, initially with a lowlevel of marketing support while the new experienceâ€™s appeal for regular visitors could be tested and benchmarked. Exhibit 1: Motivational Segments for FY Apr â€˜22 to Mar â€™23 (ALL BLENHEIM PALACE VISITORS) Segment name Motivation description Estimated % of Paying Visitors â€œTicking the Boxâ€ Typically coming for a one-off visit, which adds to their repertoire of â€˜must-seeâ€™ destinations 32% â€œSpecial Eventsâ€ May have visited before, now returning for a temporary special exhibition, either historically-themed, or possibly contemporary art, or a music / theatre event. 18% â€œBroadening Horizonsâ€ Interested in expanding their knowledge, will often choose guided tours and use the experience as an educational opportunity. 12% â€œFun for Childrenâ€ With a light touch of cultural enrichment, the visit provides space to play and entertaining places for kidsâ€™ imaginations to run wild. 5% â€œStroll and Chatâ€ A fresh-air and beautiful palatial place to wander and meet with friends for a social, wellbeing â€“ and possibly dining â€“ experience. 25% â€œAdventure Seekersâ€ Here for an adult â€˜playgroundâ€™ â€“ somewhere to cycle, run or walk-to, and roam around for a gently thrilling day out.\n\n\n\nExhibit 2: Geographical Spread of UK Visitors, based on online ticket purchases (FOR ALL BLENHEIM PALACE VISITORS) Area / region % Greater London 39% Oxford and Oxfordshire 10% Other â€“ within 2.5hrs 17% Other â€“ beyond 2.5hrs 34% The green bounded area represents an area of 2.5hrs drive to / from Blenheim Palace.\n\n\n\n\nThe Task Overall Marketing Objective Based on numbers so far, in the current year, it is projected that The Adventure Play experience will have attracted c. 85,000 new paying visitors, with an initial Â£100K level of â€˜new productâ€™ marketing support targeted to the local Oxford area. Now for the FY Apr â€™24 to â€˜Mar 25 we want to develop a dedicated marketing communications plan, with the overall marketing objective to attract 200,000 paying visitors who will have come for the â€œFun for Childrenâ€ motive, with the appeal of The Adventure Play experience central to their reason for visiting.\n\n\n\n\nAudiences Adventure Play is attractive to new audience sub-segments, who might not previously have seen Blenheim Palace as relevant to them. An example of those sub-segments â€“ as well as other insights â€“ are here. [there may be other audience targets you identify, beyond these.] Competition It is a competitive space with â€˜adventurous playâ€™ options for children that include Go Ape and Cotswold Wildlife Park. Although it is also possible that other local attractions focused on children, like the Story Museum, in Oxford, and the â€˜Harry Potterâ€™ tours, might be complementary to a visit to the Blenheim Palace Adventure Play. Channels Blenheim Palace marketing communications have taken a multi-channel approach, including: ï‚· OOH / outdoor advertising ï‚· Radio advertising ï‚· Social media paid-for advertising (Facebook, Youtube etc) ï‚· PR in national, local and lifestyle media and broadcast media ï‚· Influencer marketing ï‚· Co-branding / licensed arrangements (e.g. with â€˜Paddington bearâ€™) ï‚· PPC / Google Ads For the purposes of this brief, you may consider some of these channels, as well as any other communications channel that you think may help you achieve the overall marketing objective. Challenge The challenge is to develop an IMC Campaign Strategy and Costed Media Schedule for Apr â€™24 to Mar â€™25, to achieve the overall marketing objective, that considers: ï‚· Geographical reach (and the scale and frequency of that reach) ï‚· Mix of channels ï‚· Tactics and integration within those channels ï‚· The weighting of audience segments / sub-segments for the communications media spend Inevitably, pricing and promotional offers will form part of the marketing tactics, but for this plan we want you to disregard these and focus on the IMC Campaign Strategy. Budget The dedicated annual budget for Adventure Play Marcomms for the FY 24/25 is Â£200,000.\n\n\n\n\nYou need to include in your report the following: ï‚· A concise summary of the Blenheim Palace brand, considering their vision, mission, and values ï‚· Based on secondary data, an analysis of key competitors, market trends, and the target audience(s) of the Blenheim Palace Adventure Play ï‚· Based on your analysis, develop and justify a big communications idea (BCI) ï‚· Fully explain and justify your marketing objective, marketing communications objectives, targeting, positioning, IMC strategy and tactics to be used ï‚· A fully-costed media schedule [estimated costs are sufficient]\n\n\nPlease note that general production costs for your campaign do not need to be specified within the report unless you are planning an activity such as organising an event. If in any doubt, please check with the module/seminar leader.\n\n\n\n\nIn your report, present only one central campaign message. Critically justify how the plan will integrate a mix of at least 5 marketing communications channels/platforms (traditional and digital). Suggest concrete ways in which the campaign will meet its specific IMC objectives to your fully defined target audience.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT You are NOT allowed to contact Blenheim Palace or Bottle PR or any of their competitors for the purpose of this coursework. Also, you are NOT allowed to contact any of Blenheim Palaceâ€™s visitors/clients/customers. All inquiries regarding Blenheim Palace and The Adventure Play must go via the module leader. Breaking this rule may lead to a referral to the academic conduct officer and might lead to a deduction of marks. Furthermore, you are required to keep this live client project completely confidential. None of the client-related information provided during this module should be shared with anybody else who is not enrolled on this module.

You are required to demonstrate an ability to keep within the word limit while still providing a comprehensive reflection.\n\nDue date: See your assessment table for the due date\n\nte in first person for this piece - it is a set of personal reflections.\n\nWhat is a reflective journal?\nReflective learning journal writing is different from other forms of academic writing. It is a piece of flexible, personal, semi-informal writing. Reflective writing requires that you think deeply and write about a learning experience. This involves writing about:\n\nWhat happened (positive and negative).\nWhy it happened, what it means, how successful it was.\nWhat you (personally) learned from the experience.\nWhen you are writing your reflective piece (and pieces of it over the course of this unit), I generally suggest following the DIEP structure outlined below, in conjunction with thinking about the above questions.\n\nOverview of our reflective journal\n\n \' We do not learn from experience...we learn from reflecting on experience. \'  John Dewey\n\nResearch shows us that one of the best ways to apply what we learn in places like university is to explicitly and critically reflect on what it all means for us in our personal and professional lives. Critical reflection is not just description, it is a hugely important skill in the workplace. That is, to be able to look back on a project you \' ve done, a particular piece of work you \' ve completed, a meeting you facilitated, or a difficult discussion you had and ask yourself questions like  \' what did I learn from this? \' ,  \' why did things go well/not well? \' ,  \' what can I do differently next time? \' , etc.\n\nFor our reflective piece you will go even further. You will be exposed to some really exciting and cutting-edge management topics in this unit (we hope you agree!). This reflective journal is about you identifying those topics that resonate most with you, explaining why they do, and then critically reflecting on how these topics (by integrating your own research on them) are developing you as a management practitioner and leader now and into the future.\n\n\nPurpose and aim of this assessment\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to challenge you to critically and deeply think about how your learnings in this unit are developing your knowledge and skills around the nature of work and your ability to lead and manage people in organisations. More broadly, this assessment also asks you to reflect on how these learnings are contributing to your professional and personal development.\n\nThe aim is to make you an active and engaged participant in your learning, continually reflecting on how and why your learning is relevant to your interactions in the wider world, not matter what sector or capacity those interactions occur in. In this assessment you will construct a reflective journal that identifies your learning and development over the course of this unit, identifies which areas are most important to you and why, and demonstrates your critical thinking, analysis and questioning skills to link what you are learning to your development as a management practitioner and leader.\n\nOur reflective journal structure\nThe DIEP structure was developed through RMIT in Melbourne and is a helpful way to structure your reflective thinking:\n\nDescribe (objectively what you learned)\nInterpret (the insight)\nEvaluate (what you have learned)\nPlan (how this learning will be applied in practice)\nRemember, reflective journals are flexible pieces of assessment - don \' t feel overly constrained by structure, but remember that you need to be reflecting critically (not just describing things) and incorporating theory (i.e., discussing the theory and frameworks from the unit), and evidence (references).\n\nThe DIEP structure is a starting point - adapt it as you need to, but ensure you cover the key areas it identifies.\n\nHow to start\n\nSee guidance on using the DIEP reflective writing process here, including example reflections -> https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/writing-academic-reflection\nEach week, think about whether a module and its related activities particularly interested you. Did something make you stop and think â€˜hey that helps explain something Iâ€™ve experienced!â€™. Or did it make you think more deeply about an experience youâ€™ve had, a news story youâ€™ve read, or something youâ€™d like to do in the future? Or did something frustrate you or was there something you didn \' t like - this is ok too! Note these points down â€“ they are the start of a written reflection\nDo further research â€“ what more can you learn about this topic since it has piqued your interest? Draw from materials in the unit, but also your own wider research.\nThe best way to capture your reflections is IN THAT MOMENT! Take notes, even dot points, as you reflect on what youâ€™re learning. These seeds will develop into your reflective journal, but donâ€™t lose the seeds because you didnâ€™t note them down!\nBuild your reflective writing using the DIEP process.\nMOST IMPORTANT POINTS\nYou have used at least 5 scholarly sources\nYou \' ve been guided by the DIEP structure\nYou \' ve used APA 7th referencing\nYou \' re within the word limit\nYou \' ve checked your Turnitin originality report and you \' re assuring us that what you submit is your work\n', NULL, 'Masters', '[\"Report Writing\"]', NULL, '2023-11-02 00:00', '3000', '', '28-10-2023 13:00:18', 'student', '16', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

(2087, 2087, 'Academic Writing', 'Consumer behaviour ', 'INDIVIDUALLY WRITTEN COURSEWORK (4000 WORDS)\nDeadline:  Friday, 8th December 2023 (end of week 10), 100% of coursework, with two formative (optional) assessments in week 6 and week 7.\n\nFrom the very beginning of this module, you are asked to choose and dedicate part of your everyday life to a behavioural change project which continues for several weeks in parallel to the course.\n\nHere are the brief specifics:\n\nâ€¢             To challenge your critical reflection skills and demonstrate how difficult it is â€“ for yourself as a consumer and as marketers - to change behaviour, students are asked to engage in a personal behavioural change project.\n\nâ€¢             This may relate to various aspects of your life and those around you, for example and by no means limited to the following ideas of past projects:\n\n-          buy more consciously, ethically or focus on sustainability (or simply switch off the light more often, stop using elevators, reduce/zero waste, no clothes shopping, etc.)\n\n-          to stop procrastinating on social media  \n\n-          give up smoking\n\n-          eat better or follow a different diet to what you are used to (which has in the past linked to reducing calories, no sweets, no chocolates, no sugar, no meat, no caffeine, 5/2 diet etc.)\n\n-          engage in more sports, no sports, practice calming activities such as mindfulness\n\n-          join a club (dance, yoga, karate, pilates, drama)\n\n-          go to the theatre or engage in creative activities more often (i.e. play an instrument, start knitting/drawing/creative writing, etc.)\n\nCovid may restrict some of your choices, but then again, maybe now more than ever, you find yourself in position where there are some things you would like to change.\n\nâ€¢             The journeys will all be very personal, depending on your own choice, and the main focus is on reflecting on the changes you notice and linking these to each weekly topic. Projects differ in that some of you will â€˜stopâ€™ doing something, and others will â€˜startâ€™ doing something, and some of you will do both, i.e. stop doing something and replace it with something new. There also tends to be a difference in whether you are starting or stopping something entirely, or gradually, and whether this behaviour is entirely new or already familiar to you. Whatever it may be, itâ€™s worth spending some time thinking about WHAT and WHY you would like to embark on this project, as it should be something that sincerely motivates you.\n\nâ€¢             You may also note that a lot of previous projects had a very individualised focus rather than change to benefit someone else; this is NOT the brief! You can very well choose to support or join a community; you may also choose to help someone in need. However, while observing the change that takes place within the group and the activities you engage in, the â€˜unit of analysisâ€™ or source of data will always be your experience of change via descriptions and reflections (i.e. how you describe events and notice your perceptions, motivations, attitudes, opinions and beliefs change as well as the routines and practices you engage in).  \n\nâ€¢             NOTE: It does not have to be something directly linked to consumption! Students had some great projects in the past about stopping to constantly â€˜say sorryâ€™, or stopping to bite nails, or keeping a straight back. Another great project was to start walking stairs and avoid elevators at all times! When you start off you may think these have little to do with consumption, but over time, you will realise how much consumption matters â€“ within the behaviour we have learned, how we are looking to change it, and why we are looking to change (to name a few ideas). And sometimes what seemed most unrelated created great ideas! For example, our student who wanted to stop biting nails found an entire product line of nail polish that make nails taste rotten so that people would stop biting them. So hey, not biting nails was a real market!\n\nâ€¢             Overall, this exercise means you are more likely to personally engage in and experience the importance of perception, motivation, learning, attitudes, routines or practices (and how this forms part of personal or inter/national cultures), self (control), identity, communities, which are of course all linked to consumption.\n\nâ€¢             To make sure you can gather your reflections and develop â€˜good dataâ€™ throughout this project, we recommend you set up a blog or maintain a diary/keep detailed notes. Projects where students maintained blogs or kept notes have been of much better quality compared to students who did not. Setting up a blog also allows you to store pictures or videos and link them to activities or experiences. Itâ€™s easily and quickly done via a host of different blog providers (see power point presentation for ideas). Also, some students have kept their blogs after the project and some even turned them into an activist campaign (to save a local pub).\n\nâ€¢             Students have until midnight, 11th October 2023, to consider their own personal â€˜change projectsâ€™, set up their blog where they write their â€˜change commitmentâ€™, and post this blog entry in the discussion forum where it will be signed off by the module convenor and tutors. If your project is too personal, email us your title and â€˜change commitmentâ€™. If you would like to share your blog address with fellow students, we encourage this via the discussion forum.\n\nÂ·       Change commitment: in your first blog post, it is advised you define the reasons for choosing your particular change project and explain your motivations for embarking on this change; to help you achieve this change, it is also advised to set up a set of goals and (gradual?) mechanisms to implement this change. However, this depends entirely on the change project you choose. For example, previously students chose to cut out all kinds of waste, or to change their daily routine by getting up at 5am. It may be tricky to create a gradual mechanism for these changes.\n\nâ€¢     Starting from the 12th October â€“ 29th November, you are asked to record and monitor your (change in) actions, practices, routines, general behaviour, thoughts, emotions, general insights and, importantly, those of people around you (i.e. not just your own behaviour but also how your environment is changing) using a blog.. The purpose of your entries is mainly for you to understand the habituated nature of your behaviour and apply the concepts that we are studying in class to your own behaviour, and hopefully your change.\n\nâ€¢            It is recommended that you regularly review, reflect and, if necessary, revise your goals to enable you in your monitoring. Goals should not be about quantifying your change â€“ as some students have thought in the past (i.e. if they reach their goals and reduce XYZ amount of calories during each week they will do well in this assignment). That is clearly not the case. But setting goals are part of rational processing of our behaviour and switches on our motivations, though (as you may observe) they may often diverge significantly from what we actually end up doing!\n\nÂ·                To aid learning and help with extensive readings, students are encouraged to establish reading groups; in these groups you can share summaries and reflect how they may relate to change; feel free to use the discussion forum for this purpose too and we can also help in setting up reading groups for you.\n\n \n\nÂ·                Reading groups can also be your seminar groups. Consider them as a sounding board â€“ a therapy group for this module! We hope you look forward to talking about your change project and share your insights with the group every week and relate it to the theories and readings from each week. \n\n \n\nÂ·                To help you gain feedback: you are asked to prepare a poster within a small group (2-3 students from your seminar groups) to jointly analyse - contrast and compare - your experiences and relations to theory in your seminar session in week 6. Please also post this poster in the discussion forum on the 8th November or soon thereafter. You will receive extensive formative feedback for your final assignment submission!\n\n \n\nâ€¢             Beside a poster presentation, please submit a 500 word abstract of your individual project in the discussion forum, highlighting your approach to analysis and identification of key literature by the end of week 7 (17th November 2023). Some minor feedback on these abstracts will be provided prior to full project submission at the end of week 10.\n\nâ€¢             Note: both posters and abstracts are FORMATIVE assessments, so non-compulsory and optional. That said, we do encourage you to complete them so you gain feedback and advice on your project, since it forms 100% of your final mark.\n\nÂ·                Your final assessment should be an analysis of your behavioural change project. This analysis should consist of a description of the journey of your change project, relevant data extracts (from your blog for example, or photos, videos, social media, etc.), and links to relevant theories and readings. In its conclusion it should also discuss how these insights relate to consumer behaviour, marketing practices, strategy or a critique of current marketing practices more generally.\n\nThe following marking criteria (in addition to standard criteria) may help in considering an appropriate structure and content for your analysis essay:\n\n-          Structure and referencing  \n\n-          Originality and topic creativity\n\n-          Detail of description of chosen phenomenon, and presentation of some data or insights to showcase how change was recorded;\n\n-          Clarity, appropriateness and depth of analysis (choice, range and depth of theories)\n\n-          Engagement with theory relevant to the personal change\n\n-          Critical argumentation, discussion and reflection â€“ both in terms of theory and practical change\n\n-          Consideration of how insights/experiences may relate to consumer behaviour more widely, marketing practices, strategy or critique of current marketing practices', NULL, 'Masters', '[\"Essay Writing\"]', NULL, '2023-12-08 11:59', '5000', '2714Cb eg4.pdf_$_2714Cb eg3.pdf_$_2714Cb eg2.pdf_$_2714Cb eg1.pdf_$_2714Poster presentation template (1) cb3.pptx_$_2714bf4eb203-3732-48a3-8ca1-c0f130ac50e6.jpeg_$_2714Cb2.pdf_$_2714Cb1.pdf_$_', '09-11-2023 07:21:47', 'student', '16', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(2088, 2088, 'Academic Writing', 'Brand management ', '*Brand management coursework*\n\nThe module is assessed based on a 3,500 words report on a brand audit. Please engage with all the resources below helping you develop your coursework.  Dedicated activities in each branding topic will also help you apply  the theories you have learned to the coursework\n\n1. General assessment information\nAssessment components\n\nThis module is assessed by a 3,500 words coursework worth 100% of the module grade. The submission deadline is Friday 8 December 2023, 18:00 via Moodle.\n\nLate submissions of Work for Assessment \n\nAny work that is submitted for formal assessment after the assessment deadline will be subject to a penalty mark, unless a Mitigating Circumstances claim is accepted.  \n\nDetails of the procedure for submitting Mitigating Circumstances claims and details of this procedure, including the Mitigating Circumstances form to complete, can be found at:  https://www.bbk.ac.uk/downloads/registry/policies-2020-21/covid-19-mit-circs-student-guidance.pdf\n\nIf you think that you may be unable to meet an assessment deadline for reasons outside your control but you are not sure whether you should apply for Mitigating Circumstances, please raise an ASK query via MyBirkbeck to the student administration. Your module teacher might be able to provide some advice, but the decision does not rest in his hands.\n\n2. Brief\nYour mission\nA new marketing director has just arrived in the company. They have asked you to send him an audit of the brand you work on, to help them decide where to take the brand next. They want your audit to go beyond a description of the brand and its current performance: they want your analysis to be an argument leading to detailed recommendations about how to further develop the brand in the future. They asked for a 3,500 words report.\n\nIn this fictional scenario, you should focus on one of those four brands:\n\nBarbie\nBen & Jerry \' s\nIKEA\nTesla\nReports are expected to apply relevant branding frameworks and concepts explored in the module. Students are welcome to leverage more advanced branding theory if helpful. Branding frameworks and concepts should be applied with the aim of enhancing the depth of analyses and insight into the brandâ€™s dynamics.\n\n\nReport Format\nThe finished reports must be written in a report format so headings, subheadings, summary tables, diagrams, bullet points, and signposting are expected. \n\nThe report is expected to be 3,500 words long, plus or minus 10%. The word count should be on the front page or it will be assumed that it was not respected, leading to penalties. Figures and charts do not count towards the word limit but should not exceed 3,500 words. The executive summary, the table of content, the references, and appendices do not count toward the word limit. \n\nThe report should be spellâ€checked, grammatically correct, and justified. The report must be typed in 12 point, doubleâ€spaced with 1 inch margin in the font of your preference.  References should be properly cited using the Harvard style. \n\nFor those using Mac or Open Office, please submit the document in a format compatible with Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF reader.\n\nReports are expected to cite seven academic sources as a minimum.\n\n3. Report structure\nReports are designed to be easily and quickly absorbed by readers. Headings are therefore typically used to separate the different sections of the document. Reports have a title page, an executive summary, a table of content, an introduction, various sections in the middle, and a conclusion. In your case, the conclusion section could be labelled something like â€œRecommendations for the Future Management of the brandâ€, since the report aims to develop recommendations for the future management of the brand. Quality reports also typically have a list of references at the end, allowing the reader to check the validity of statements made in the report, and to go further if they wish. Beyond these basic principles of report writing, you are free to structure the rest of your analysis as you deem fit, given the particular problem that the brand is facing. \n\nStudents often feel unsure about how to structure their report though. I therefore offer below a suggestion of outline, that often helps students find what works best for their brand.\n\n \n\nTitle Page â€“ should be informative, use two or three lines if necessary. Indicate word count.\n\nExecutive Summary (200â€250 words) â€“ The executive summary gives the reader an overview of the reportâ€™s content. It summarizes briefly the takeaways of the different sections of the report. It will therefore include a clear statement of the problem faced by the brand, the analyses conducted, the diagnostic you got to and the recommendations you offer. The marketing director will have no interest in reading an executive summary which is a rewriting of the table of content. An executive summary for a report of this size is typically written in a single paragraph.\n\nContents list â€“ shows the main sections and, if appropriate, subâ€sections of the report, alongside the pages on which the reader can find them.\n\n1. Introduction (350 words)â€“ tells the reader in a few words what is discussed in the report and why it is important. It could, inter alia, a) provide a brief overview of the brand b) defines briefly the industry and context in which the brand operates c) presents with some level of detail the most important branding problem(s) or questions the brand is facing d) provide a brief overview of the dataset you collected to investigate the problem e) outline how your analysis will allow you to respond to such problem(s).\n\n2. Brand audit â€“ The branding concepts and theoretical frameworks learned in the module in class or via independent readings will be particularly relevant here. When applying them, try to systematically draw conclusions from your analyses, explaining how it helps understand and resolve the problem outlined in the introduction. The main analysis will be divided in different sections with potential sub-headings within. You are free to organize it as you deem fit. However, it is typically relevant to discuss the following topics, in which ever order suits your purpose best:\n\n2.1. Brand concept: What are the brandâ€™s promise? What are the brandsâ€™ identity and positioning?  And have they evolved overtime? Does the brand have a strong heritage? And how rich is the brandâ€™s identity? Can you describe the specifics of all this? If you develop a systematic comparison of competitorsâ€™ POPs and PODs, keep this comparison for an Appendix, so the main text remains focused on your main narrative or  argument.\n\n2.2 Consumer-based brand equity: How much value has the brand for consumers? What level of awareness of the brand do they have and is it adequate? What image of the brand do they have? Is it a strong image and is it the right image? Does the brand resonate with consumers and should it? Is the brandâ€™s equity dispersed, with different segments having different images of the brand? Is the brandâ€™s equity polarized, with a doppelganger brand image emerging? Does the brand suffer from negative equity?\n\n2.3. Brand elements: What are the elements characterizing the brand? Which ones convey the brandsâ€™ identity and positioning well and which ones do not? Which ones are designed effectively and which ones are not? Try and articulate the criteria used to assess the elements. You can use a table for this, which allows you to leverage the main text to (1) explain where you gathered the information to assess the brand elements and (2) develop a short synthesis explaining what is right and wrong about the elements and why. If you do not have anything interesting to say about the brand elements, given the particular problem/question you presented in the introduction, consider keeping this section short. Or maybe even describe them briefly in the introduction, when giving a brief overview of the brand, or draw from it when analyzing the brandâ€™s identity. However, if you chose not to have a section on brand elements, explain briefly in the introduction why you will not analyze them in-depth in the main body of the text and provide more details in an Appendix.\n\n2.4. Marketing mix: How fit or unfit is the marketing mix, given the particular problem the brand is facing? Does it enact the brand concept adequately? Does it take the brandâ€™s positive and/or negative equity into account? If relevant in your particular case, you might want to focus on only a few aspects of the marketing mix, or only marketing communications. However, if you do so, you should explain the rationale for it in the introduction or the introduction of the section.\n\nIt is also often relevant to integrate discussions of brand dynamics (reinforcement, expansion, rejuvenation) within the topics listed above. This could involve for example discussing: does the brand have some history/heritage which belongs to its identity? Does the brandsâ€™ resonance create opportunity to expand? Or is the brand losing relevance? If so, is it due to its narrow and shallow identity? Or to its outdated positioning? To its marketing mix choices or to the management of its portfolio?\n\n3. Recommendations (750 words) - this section starts with a brief, concise and clear summary of the evaluations/conclusions you came up with in the report. It often involves repeating statements that have appeared in previous sections, but the reader will not want to go back and find these. Rather, they will want them all clearly set out in the same place. It must also include explicit recommendations. The recommendations should be clearly linked to the problem identified and build on the conclusions you came to when evaluating the brand. Otherwise, it will seem as if the whole audit was useless. Be very detailed, precise and structured in the recommendations you make.  based on your analysis and assessment of the brand.\n\nRecommendations will be unique to your brand and project. However, it is often useful to consider organizing your recommendations in terms of high-level strategic recommendations vs more applied tactical recommendations (brand elements, marketing mix).\n\nIf you struggle to define a strategic direction in your recommendations, you will likely find the last three topic of the module helpful:\n\n-       Brand portfolio: Would the brand benefit from an extension and why? If so, in which product category? With which architecture? How will you mitigate the risks and ensure this is a success? Is the brand part of a larger portfolio? If so, should the brand review the portfolioâ€™s architecture?\n\n-       Brand iconicity: Is the brand culturally relevant and why? What could the brand do to enhance or maintain its cultural relevance?\n\n-       Brand activism: Would the brand benefit from playing up its social purpose and why? If so, how should it go about it?\n\n 4. List of References â€“ you need to list the sources you have used and cited in the report. You should list the books and journal articles you cited but also the reports, the websites, the blogs and the various social media pages you have used. The recommended format is as below. To help the marker cross-check references, you are welcome to have a separate references list for each section of the report.\n\nÂ·  BOOKS: Surname, name initials, (date of publication), Title of book (italics or underlined), publisher, place of publication, chapter number.   Example: Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Saunders, J. and Wong, V. (1996) Principle of Marketing, European Edition, Prentice Hall, Europe.\n\nÂ·  ARTICLES: Surname, Name initials, (date of publication), â€œTitleâ€, name of journal (italics), issue, page numbers. Example: Houston, F. S. (1986) â€œThe Marketing Concept: What It Is and What It Is Notâ€, Journal of Marketing, 50,  (April), 81-Â­â€87.\n\nÂ·  REPORTS: Surname, Name initials. (date of publication). â€œTitleâ€. Series Number. City: Publisher, p.Pages Used. Available at: http://Website URL [Accessed Date Accessed].\n\nÂ·  WEBSITE: Surname, Name initials, or Website name (date of publication) â€œPage Titleâ€. Available at: http://Website URL [Accessed Date Accessed].\n\n5. Appendices â€“information which is not central to the argument developed in the report but supports in some ways may be included in the appendices. Appendices can be useful to cut down the descriptive parts in the main body of the report.\n\n4. Marking criteria\nThe reports will be assessed based on the following criteria:\n\n1. Quality of the argument: Development of an in-depth analysis of the brand leading to relevant and convincing branding recommendations. Provision of new insights or original ideas based on independent thought or creative thinking.\n\nReports being genuinely analytical and evaluative will be marked up while merely descriptive reports will be marked down. A description tells you how something is. An analysis breaks down the thing into pieces. An evaluation says if the way the thing is used or built is right or wrong. Analysis and evaluation require writing argumentatively. Anything taking the reader away from the argument should be cut or taken in appendix.\n\n2. Use of research and examples: The breadth and quality of sources identified to do the coursework and their meaningful use to analyse the brand.\nA good report will demonstrate some initiative in searching out a wide range of relevant sources and information about the brand. Corporate publicity and advertising, company and industry reports, independent market research, case studies and academic research articles are all relevant sources when gathering information about the brand. Reports, which lean too heavily on a very narrow range of sources typically receive lower marks. \n\n3. Depth of knowledge and critical understanding: Depth of knowledge of relevant literature and ability to use complex concepts and ideas.\n\nAll reports should also leverage academic theory. A good report will take every opportunity to appropriately apply the concepts, models and techniques encountered in the module and its associated reading. This commonly involves applying analytical frameworks to organize and interpret the sources characterizing the brand. It also involves building from concepts to help you interpret some particular aspects of the data collected, or to help you develop branding recommendations. \n\nStudents are welcome to read academic sources behind the textbook and use any academic knowledge relevant for the particular brand chosen. \n\n4. Structure and presentation: A logical arrangement of the work into sections (introduction, main points, conclusion) with appropriate signposting and transitions. Putting across ideas clearly, succinctly and without grammatical and spelling errors. In the case of oral presentation, ability of the presenter to engage the audience is also important.\n\n5. Referencing and bibliography: Acknowledgement of sources using appropriate citation conventions in text and in the list of references at the end.\n', NULL, 'Masters', '[\"Report Writing\",\"Essay Writing\"]', NULL, '2023-12-08 18:00', '5000', '2714Brand management eg1.pdf_$_2714Brand management eg4.pdf_$_2714Brand management eg2.pdf_$_2714Brand management eg5.pdf_$_2714Brand management eg3.pdf_$_2714Brand management eg1.pdf_$_', '09-11-2023 07:35:20', 'student', '16', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Also, please make sure you have watched the videos for the two practicals for this module linked from the Canvas pages, DNA designs using Benchling and DNA Parts finding. You should also complete the entire module 1 of the course and the lectures on Parts, Systems and Devices and Standards.\n\nBackground\n\nWelcome to your new job! You have been employed as a Synthetic Biology consultant by a biotechnology company who wishes to improve the yield of an enzyme that they current produce from a recombinant strain of Bacillus subtilis 168. The company produces the recombinant xylanase enzyme by overexpressing the gene encoding it on a plasmid pHT01, an Escherichia coli/Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector (see figure 1 and https://www.addgene.org/vector-database/5885/Links to an external site. and http://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/PHT01). The gene encoding the enzyme has been inserted into pHT01 downstream of the IPTG inducible P grac promoter on the plasmid at the Bam HI site.\n\nPlasmid pHT01\n\nFigure 1: pHT01 plasmid\n\n \n\nThe overexpressed product is secreted outside of the cell wall into the cell medium using the Bacillus cell type 2 secretory system. The company purifies the enzyme by filtering away the cells and then extracting the enzyme from the supernatant.\n\nThe company have asked you to design a system for them that will allow them explore the level of load stress that the cell is experiencing during the batch growth of the strain in a bioreactor that is used to produce the protein. The company also want you to develop a system that will allow them to apply a load stress to the strain and to monitor its behaviour.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nThe company has captured the requirements for the system more formally as follows:\n\nThe system must be tailored for operation in Bacillus subtilis\nThe system must have a reporter system (the monitor) that can produce green fluorescent protein (GFP).\nThe level of expression of GFP in the monitor must be proportional to the amount of free resources available for transcription and translation in the cell.\nThe monitor must exist as a single copy number\nThe system must include a load generator that allows a load stress to applied to the cell by the expression of a gene encoding a xylanase enzyme.\nThe load generator should also express red fluorescent protein (RFP) proportionally to the induction of the expression of the xylanase gene.\nThe load generator should be inserted into the shuttle-vector pHT01 as the company is familiar with this vector.\nThe company is unwilling to release the sequence of the xylanase gene it uses and so requires you to provide to use a publicly available sequence of your choice.\nThe deliverables\n\nThere are two deliverables to be submitted to the NESS system:\n\n1) A non-weighted practical report. Deadline Friday 10th November 2023 at 16:30PM.\n\nTo complete this part you must start to think about how you will design and build the system that meets the requirements stated above for the assignment. Talk to the lecturer or demonstrator about your plans for the design and get some feedback. This doesn \' t need to be very detailed at this stage. Just some rough ideas will suffice. \n\nPlease upload the feedback you received from the demonstrator on your system design during the practical and details of any fixes you carried out as a result, if any. A simple document with a short paragraph of text will suffice. \n\nThis component of the assessment is marked with a pass fail mark. The component must be passed but does not contribute to the mark for the module. \n\n2)  A practical report that is marked (total 100), which will make up the total mark for the module. Deadline Friday 17th November 2023 at 16:30PM.\n\nArmed with the requirements for the system presented above your task is to provide a design for a system to detect and apply load Stress in Bacillus subtilis 168 that conforms to the requirements above. The design must be detailed enough for the company to build the system. Specifically, you must produce four sections in this report.\n\nA verbal description of the behaviour of the system you have designed, once it has been built (10 marks total, 1000 words max)\nProvide a visual overview of the design (using a visual standard) and a textual description of the genetic structure. Provide justification for your design choices (10 marks, 1000 words max)\nLists the parts used, their types, sources and function ( \' role \' ) (5 marks)\nList the sequences of the parts in Fasta format.  ** Put the sequences in a separate document ** (10 marks)\nProvide a Benchling project with the design represented in it (15 marks). Share your Benchling designs for the project with Anil. To do this search for the user  \' naw3 \'  and set them as a collaborator.

You are to research and assess these various components of corporate strategy for your FTSE100 corporation (as it is currently, not a historical account, although the administrative heritage of a corporation is certainly relevant to some of its competencies and positioning in its market today). Based on your assessment, write a concise, logically-structured business report about the mid- to long-term prospects of your FTSE100 Corporation to create value for its shareholders. Offer at least three impactful recommendations for enhancing the corporate strategy of your FTSE100 corporation, consistent with the content of this module.\nRemember, this is a business report (not an academic paper), where your target reader is a senior business executive. To promote stronger structured logical thinking and communication to concisely convey your argumentation, it is recommended that you follow a business writing technique such as Minto Pyramid Principle.

It should include how marketing can support them to achieve this. \n\nIn addressing the above question, you should make the following choices:\n1)	Choose a specific consumer segment who engage in a specific consumption behaviour occurring in response to an ethical problem. You can phrase this as a problem or opportunity. Here are some suggestions to help you to develop your own ideas. You do not need to choose from any of them. You can chose anything that will enable you to answer the assignment question. Please ask your tutor if you are unsure:\nï€­	Climate change and sustainable development, e.g. sustainable consumption; consumption reduction (e.g. shifting lifestyles to sharing/leasing not buying, pre-owned/recycled/ repurposed consumption choices); consumer activists and anti-consumption. \nï€­	Ethics of artificial intelligence in consumption choices. Examples include designing AI to inform consumerâ€™s decision-making (e.g. online shopping â€“ getting purchasing right first time to prevent waste). Developing positive body image Chabotâ€™s to promote a healthy body image among younger consumers to address negative body-image problems.\nï€­	Ethics of dietary choices. For example, in response to food/water insecurity, biodiversity, and animal welfare considerations. This has supported shifts to â€˜different lifestylesâ€™ including vegan, flexitarian, anti-meat, artificial food (e.g. lab-made â€˜meatâ€™).\n2)	Focus on one consumer segment pertinent to your topic and country/sector choice. You should develop a profile of this segment, providing as much pertinent information as you can, e.g. using socio-demographics, psychographics. Please present visually, or in table format, fully referenced.\n3)	Focus on one country for your essay. Having this focus will make it a lot easier for you to identify and evaluate the evidence within the word limit specified.\n4)	While you are required to use personal values theory for your essay, you MUST focus on a specific model or framework within it. For example, Rokeach, Schwartz, VBN model, etc. Choose ONE of these. Do NOT include multiple values frameworks/models in your essay because this will undermine the depth of analysis you can achieve within the 3000 word count limit.\nOnce you make the above choices, you are required to investigate research evidence from academic articles, news from legitimate sources, industry reports etc. to critically analyse how consumer behaviour has changed in response to the ethical problem you have identified. Building from this appraisal, you will explain, evaluate and apply your values framework/model to your chosen issue.

In your analysis, you could consider things like:\nâ€¢ How are consumers \'  motivation, ability, and opportunity addressed?\nâ€¢ How are consumers exposed to the product/service/brand?\nâ€¢ How does the commercial try to capture consumers \'  attention?\nâ€¢ How is consumers \'  perception influenced?\nâ€¢ How do consumers understand the message of the commercial?\nâ€¢ How are consumers \'  attitudes shaped or changed?\nâ€¢ How are emotions being manipulated? What is the goal behind that?\nâ€¢ How is the decision-making process influenced?\nâ€¢ How is the commercial related to ethical considerations in marketing?\nâ€¢ How are different psychographics aspects (e.g., values, personality) used?\nMore guidance\nThe most important aspect of the assignment is to correctly apply the course theories. Answers that do not use these theories, or that demonstrate a lack of understanding of the theories (as discussed in class and in the course readings), will be deemed unsatisfactory. Answers that use definitions or conceptualizations of the theories that are inconsistent with the way they were discussed in the course will also be deemed unsatisfactory.\nThe second most important aspect of the assignment is to apply the theories insightfully. This includes understanding the theories well enough to use them in the analysis of the chosen commercial. For example, stating that the commercial attracts consumers \'  attention is not very insightful because most commercials are designed to attract attention. A good answer would demonstrate a deep understanding of the course theories and apply them insightfully as they relate to the unique aspects of your chosen commercial. Ideal answers will include four sections:\n1. Short description of the commercial you are going to analyse. This will help you focus on the most important aspects of the commercial.\n2. Analysis of the commercial from the perspective of the consumer behavior principles. This section should briefly describe the theories and principles that are relevant for your analysis. Then you should use these theories and principles to examine the commercial and explain how they were implemented. Use subheadings to structure your analysis.\n3. Short evaluation of what was good and bad about the commercial. This should be based on your analysis and not only just your personal opinion. It is fine to let your personal opinion and preferences guide your thoughts in this section, but your statements in this section should be backed up by your analysis. Simply saying that you liked it (or did not like it) is not enough. It has to be based on your analysis in section 2.\n4. References/Bibliography. Use formal citation rules (either APA or Harvard).', NULL, 'Masters', '[\"Essay Writing\",\"Report Writing\",\"Research Paper\"]', NULL, '2023-12-13 03:00', '4000', '27254f0b6aae-0772-4cb3-b25f-f494dce37f13.jpeg_$_27254493fc9f-b042-4865-8821-5a845221475d.jpeg_$_2725ec8b20dd-3b8d-4952-9d74-17005dfc8ea3.jpeg_$_2725436eb584-d708-41a5-bf0a-4dd3e7edefa0.jpeg_$_27251a87b063-4f46-48a2-ab50-fb0ee8737194.jpeg_$_2725cefdc8ae-81cf-4969-9b48-efc7c7026062.jpeg_$_', '12-12-2023 22:10:02', 'student', '16', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(2214, 2214, 'Academic Writing', 'BUSM094 â€“ Introduction to Marketing Theory and Concepts Assessment 1. Individual essay (100%): A 3000-word essay ', 'Marks of up to 5% points will be deducted if you overshoot the word limit. However, you may exceed\nby 10% (i.e. 3300 words).\nGeneral idea: Analysis of a brand and a brand failure.\nYou should select a brand that is different from what you are working on in other modules (because\nof self-plagiarism).\nPart A (Background, SWOT, and Brand Personality)\nï‚· A1 Background: Provide a brief background of the brand. You can use non-academic resources\nin this section. This section should give a general background of the brand (providing some\nfacts and figures would be useful). Support your arguments with reliable resources, facts, and\nfigures.\nï‚· A2 SWOT Matrix: 3-4 points per cell would be enough. You must support your claims with\nreferences. Simply saying â€œStrong brand imageâ€ as a strength is not enough (even if the brand\nis well-known). Facts and figures? Statistics? Reliable reports? Evidence? Unreferenced claims\nare not acceptable.\nï‚· A3 Brand Personality: In this section, the student is expected to discuss/identify the\npersonality of the selected brand (see Aakerâ€™s brand personality framework). A brief literature\nreview of â€˜brand personalityâ€™ is needed. Support the identified personality with some pieces\nof evidence (e.g. advertisements, marketing campaigns, pricing, videos, design, logo, package,\noffering, communication channels, sponsorship, or ANY other marketing element/activity).\nPut screenshots and explain/interpret your evidence and claims. Donâ€™t leave your screenshots\nand evidence without explanation and interpretation. For instance, if you put a screenshot\nfrom a video, briefly explain the video, then provide your interpretation and analysis of how\nthis video creates/strengthens the identifies brand personality. What elements or messages\nin the video align with the identified brand personality?\nGeneral idea of Part B: Part B focuses on a failed marketing activity. The activity can be an\nadvertisement, a marketing campaign, a brand extension project, a product introduction, and etc. As\na result, you should select a brand that had a failure in the past. At first, the failure should be\ndescribed, and then, using one of the frameworks we had in the module (e.g. the 7Ps model, PESTLE,\nSWOT (weaknesses or threats), Porter \' s 5 forces, etc.), the essay should explain/analyse the\nreason(s) of the failure. You do not need to use the whole framework to analyse/explain the failure.\nNormally, the failure can be explained with one or two elements of a framework. Pick only those\nelements that are related to the failure and can explain it. For example, if your selected brand had a\nfailure in an advertisement, the 7Ps model would be a good choice. Then, you may focus on\nâ€œPromotionâ€ part of the 7Ps model (because advertising is a Promotional activity). You do not need to\nuse all the other elements of the 7Ps model in this case. The essay also needs to provide evidence to\nshow that the failure undeniably happened (for instance, a decrease in sales, negative comments on\nsocial media, boycott by consumers, a decrease in market share, significant customer dissatisfaction, being unable to attract customers in the target market, and etc.).\nPart B (Failure Case, Literature Review, Discussion, and Recommendations)\nï‚· B1 Failure Case: The essay should describe what happened (the story of the failure). You must\nprovide evidence to show that the failure undeniably happened (i.e. why do you think that it\nwas a failure for the brand?).\nï‚· B2 Literature Review: This section briefly reviews the literature of the selected framework\n(e.g. the 7Ps model, PESTLE, SWOT (weaknesses or threats), Porter \' s 5 forces, etc.). You should\nnot talk about the brand and its failure in this section. Use this section to review the literature,\nmarketing theories, and concepts. Use of academic resources (i.e. academic articles from\nacademic journals, textbooks) is expected in this section. First, provide a general and brief\nreview of the selected framework (a short paragraph would be enough). Then, focus on the\nliterature of the selected element(s) (e.g. definitions, the importance, different types,\nantecedents, outcomes, relationship with important KPIs, etc.).\nï‚· B3 Discussion: This section discusses why the failure happened by using the literature. Try to\nreason and argue in this section, and support your arguments with the literature. Hence, it is\ntime to link the failure story with the literature/theories/concepts reviewed in the previous\nsection. In fact, you should explain the reason(s) of the failure with an academic language (by\nâ€œacademic languageâ€, we mean the literature you reviewed). You might also want to compare\nyour findings with the findings in the literature. Do you see any consistency or inconsistency?\nï‚· B4 Recommendations: Provide 3-4 recommendations. The first recommendation must be\nrelated to the failure case (explain how they could prevent the failure). Other\nrecommendations can be in any aspect. Taking a look at the weaknesses in your SWOT table\nmight be helpful. You need to be as specific as possible. Support your arguments to show that\nyour recommendations really enhance the brand. General recommendations are normally\nshallow and vague.\nReferences: Lists the papers and the sources you have used (Harvard style).\nAppendices (optional): Use this section if you need to provide any information that you cannot\nmention it in the main body of the essay (maybe tables, graphs, charts, and etc.).\nThe word count for this assessment does not include reference lists and appendices.\nName your file as: BUSM094 [full name] [stu. number] e.g. BUSM094 Johnny Depp 1234567\nThe following table may be informative and help you to have an estimate regarding the length of\neach section. You do not necessarily need to follow this table for your essay.\nParts Sections Words (approximately) Weight\nPart A\nA1 Background 200\n30%\nA2 SWOT 400\nA3 Brand Personality 400\nPart B\nB1 The failure case 300\n60%\nB2 Literature review 700\nB3 Discussion 700\nB4 Recommendations 300\nReferences - - 10% (Ref and writing)\nAppendices - - -\nYou are NOT allowed to select Southwest Airlines Co., Coca-Cola, or Burger King as\nyour brand since the focus of the provided exemplars are on these brands.', NULL, 'Masters', '[\"Essay Writing\",\"Research Paper\"]', NULL, '2023-12-14 00:00', '4000', '2725Assignment Brief BUSM094.pdf_$_2725Week 02 - Lectures - BUSM094.pdf_$_2725Assignment Brief BUSM094.pdf_$_2725Week 08 - Lectures - BUSM094.pdf_$_', '12-12-2023 22:17:02', 'student', '16', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This detailed examination covered political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, environmental, and legal factors, providing a robust foundation for our strategic insights.\n\nStrategic Group Analysis (Rohi): Rohi took charge of analyzing the strategic groups within the industry. This involved identifying key players and assessing their similarities and differences, laying the groundwork for understanding competitive dynamics.\n\nPorter \' s Five Forces Analysis (You): I conducted a detailed Porter \' s Five Forces analysis, offering valuable insights into the competitive landscape. This step allowed us to gauge the industry \' s dynamics, assessing factors such as buyer power, supplier power, and the threat of new entrants.\n\nInternal Analysis (Dev): Simultaneously, Dev led the internal analysis, delving into the organization \' s strengths and weaknesses. This introspective examination set the stage for understanding the internal dynamics of our subject.\n\nValue Chain Analysis (Ali and Ranadesh): Ali and Ranadesh meticulously dissected the organization \' s value chain, unveiling internal processes contributing to value creation. This insight provided a deeper understanding of the company \' s operational intricacies.\n\nSWOT Analysis (Entire Group): The capstone of Phase 1 was a SWOT analysis, where the entire group synthesized findings from PESTEL, strategic group analysis, Porter \' s Five Forces, and internal analysis. This holistic approach illuminated the organization \' s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\n\nPhase 2: Strategic Planning and Execution\nBuilding upon the comprehensive understanding gained in Phase 1, Phase 2 focused on strategic planning and execution.\n\nCorporate Strategy (Ali and Ranadesh): Ali and Ranadesh explored the overarching direction and scope of the organization. This involved contemplating diversification opportunities, mergers, and acquisitions, contributing to a robust corporate strategy.\n\nCompetitive Strategy (Rohi and You): Rohi and I collaborated on analyzing the competitive strategy. We delved into how the organization competes within its industry, exploring avenues such as cost leadership, differentiation, and focus.\n\nDevelopment Strategy (Vivek and Dev): Vivek and Dev spearheaded the exploration of strategies for the organization \' s growth and evolution. This involved forward-thinking initiatives to ensure long-term success.\n\nGroup Dynamics and Success Evaluation\nThroughout the simulation, our group adhered to a commitment of equal efforts. Despite encountering challenges, the missed deadlines were met with adaptability and resilience, culminating in the success of the simulation. The group \' s ability to navigate complexities and deliver a cohesive analysis reflects our collective strength.\n\nConclusion and Future Implications\nIn conclusion, our collaborative strategic analysis showcased the diverse strengths of individual members. From the initial environmental scan to the detailed internal analysis and strategic planning, each component seamlessly integrated into a comprehensive report. The success of this simulation not only demonstrated our ability to handle diverse tasks but also highlighted the importance of a unified approach in strategic analysis.\n\nAs we move forward, we acknowledge the valuable insights gained from this simulation.

Usually, to read Braille, one must trace each line from left to right using their fingertips and sense of touch. Braille is present in just a very small portion of written or printed texts. A system for automatic recognition of Braille Text to English or English Text to Braille is necessary to bridge the gap between visually sighted people and other people via which they both may communicate. There is always a need for a system that can do both i.e.  can take Braille written text or text images and convert them into equivalent English text via which keen sighted people can understand braille text and easily communicate with visually impaired people  and can take English written text or text images from the system and convert them into equivalent Braille code. Our system will take the dataset of Braille Character Images which will be used to identify the Braille text characters from images. Braille text Images will be converted into English text using CNN model. The system will utilize the potent Open-Source Tesseract OCR Engine to extract the english text from images utilizing and then convert the text to Grade 1 Braille  which is the most basic format and Grade 2 Braille which is a little advanced.

The ESP32-CAM combines the ESP32 microcontroller with a camera module, making it suitable for applications that require both Wi-Fi connectivity and image capturing capabilities. Below is a high-level overview of the components and the steps to build the system: Components: 1. ESP32-CAM Development Board: ESP32-CAM module with built-in camera and Wi-Fi. 2. QR Code Scanner Module: An external QR code scanner module compatible with ESP32. 3. IR Proximity Sensors (2x): Use two IR proximity sensors for entry and exit points. 4. Servo Motor: Choose a suitable servo motor to control the parking barrier. 5. Power Supply: Provide a stable power supply to the ESP32-CAM and other components. 6. Optional Components: LED indicators, resistors, capacitors, etc., based on specific implementation needs. Steps to Build: 1. Hardware Setup: â€¢ Connect the VCC and GND pins of the QR code scanner module to a 5V power source. â€¢ Connect the data (UART or GPIO) pins of the QR code scanner to the corresponding pins on the ESP32-CAM. â€¢ Connect the VCC and GND pins of the IR sensors to a 3.3V power source. â€¢ Connect the output pins of the entry and exit IR sensors to separate GPIO pins on the ESP32-CAM. â€¢ Connect the VCC and GND pins of the servo motor to a 5V power source. â€¢ Connect the signal/control pin of the servo motor to a GPIO pin on the ESP32-CAM. â€¢ Optionally, connect LED indicators (with current-limiting resistors) to GPIO pins for visual feedback. 2. QR Code Scanning: â€¢ Use the ESP32-CAM to capture an image of the QR code. â€¢ Process the image to extract the QR code data using an image processing library like OpenCV or a QR code library. â€¢ Validate the QR code data to ensure it represents a valid parking reservation. 3. IR Sensor Integration: â€¢ Read the status of the entry and exit IR sensors using GPIO pins of the ESP32-CAM. â€¢ Use the IR sensor data to detect vehicle presence at the entry and exit points. 4. Barrier Control: â€¢ Based on the QR code validation and IR sensor data, control the servo motor to open or close the parking barrier. â€¢ When a valid QR code is scanned and the entry IR sensor detects a vehicle, open the barrier to allow entry. â€¢ Monitor the exit IR sensor to detect a vehicle leaving the parking lot and open the barrier accordingly. 5. Wi-Fi Connectivity: â€¢ Use the ESP32-CAM \' s Wi-Fi capabilities to communicate with a backend server for QR code validation, reservation data, and parking duration. 6. Image Storage: â€¢ Optionally, store images of the vehicles entering and exiting the parking lot for security and audit purposes. 7.

There, I handled the lab roles up and close and learnt about various biomedical research disciplines. Along with carrying my dissertation at the institute, I co-wrote a review article with a research fellow on drug resistance in Breast Cancer which only recently has been in talks of getting submitted for publishing. There, I got first-hand experience in scientific writing and research skills. It also taught me about how I have the calibre of being efficient in a time-restricted environment, along with submitting experimental analyses.  Last year, I decided to give up the boxed life and be an explorer, and only recently, I wrote long-form blogs for a well-established keto lifestyle website.

I mainly taught algebra, geometry, calculus, and trigonometry to students in grades 10, 11, and 12. The instruction was done online utilising video conferencing capabilities because there were no classes.\r\n\r\nThe switch to online instruction was difficult at first. However, I quickly adapted to the online setting and created an interactive, engaging teaching style. To keep the students interested and motivated, I utilised a mix of lecture-style instruction, group problem-solving sessions, and interactive quizzes.\r\n\r\nThe pupils\' diversions from being at home during the lockdown made it one of my tasks to keep them engaged and focused. To combat this, I promoted involvement, gave frequent feedback, and established a welcoming learning atmosphere where students could ask questions and get answers to their uncertainties.\r\n\r\nAdapting to the various learning demands of the kids presented another difficulty. To make sure that no student was left behind, I had to modify my teaching methods to accommodate pupils with various learning capacities. \r\n\r\nDespite the difficulties, I felt that working with youngsters in a school during a lockdown was tremendously rewarding. It was satisfying to be able to assist pupils in overcoming obstacles and achieving academic success. I was also able to improve my understanding of maths topics and my teaching abilities as a result of the experience.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it was both difficult and enjoyable for me to work as a maths instructor during the Covid-19 shutdown. In order to support students in their academic endeavors and help them achieve at a difficult period, I was able to adapt to the virtual environment.', 'sample.docx_$_', 'Copy of Minimalist White and Grey Professional Resume.pdf_$_', '', NULL),

I built a custom solution that allowed them to monitor key performance indicators like sales by region, top-selling products, and inventory levels, and provided them with actionable insights that they could use to optimize their operations and improve profitability.\r\n\r\nAnother project involved analyzing data from a social media platform using Python and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in user behavior and sentiment. This involved cleaning and preprocessing the data, running statistical analyses, and using tools like scikit-learn and TensorFlow to build predictive models that could help the client to better understand their users and optimize their marketing campaigns.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these projects, I also worked on several Tableau dashboards for clients in industries ranging from healthcare to finance. These dashboards allowed the clients to visualize complex data sets and gain insights into key trends and patterns, such as patient outcomes, financial performance, and customer demographics.\r\n\r\nThroughout my freelance work, I developed a deep expertise in data analysis and visualization, as well as machine learning techniques and programming languages like Python. I\'m passionate about helping businesses to unlock the full potential of their data and using technology to drive real-world results.', 'movie recommendation system.pptx_$_', 'Manthan Deshpande final res.pdf_$_', NULL, NULL),
