My \r\n\r\nclient buys the fabric from a third party and give it to manufacturers who have \r\n\r\nbeen informed by us about the design required and then after the garments \r\n\r\nare manufactured and sold to retailers. The client is facing problems with the \r\n\r\nthe inventory of garments. The client has lost many transactions over the years as \r\n\r\nwell as the name of the retailers he sold them to all over the country which makes it difficult to contact those retailers for potential business opportunities. As the client is in the wholesaling business, he deals with quantities in the high hundreds and sometimes even thousands for a particular garment, and as the client has no digital framework to keep track of these garments it makes it difficult to know as to how much of a particular colour or a sample of a garment is remaining. The client also cannot keep track of whether or not only the designated person has entered the details in the book containing inventory and garments. And does not know if any details have been falsified. The client also has trouble recording the attendance of his employees, the clientâ€™s employees are only entitled to 8 days of holidays apart from festive seasons and they are subject to lose their salary if they exceed the 8-day limit.\r\n\r\nRationale â€“ The major \r\n\r\nproblems Mr. Rajendra and his company was facing was the attendance \r\n\r\nrecord of his employees and the amount of garments that were sold in which \r\n\r\nsize and colour. I have decided to make a software that will enable him to keep track of all these things such as customer names, garments sold, colour of garment sold and the size. The software will also include a feature where Mr. Rajendra can mark the attendance of an employee. \r\n\r\nTo create the following project, I will utilise NetBeans (Java OOP). Java \r\nprogrammes are interoperable with any operating system, making them easy to run on my client\'s computer. NetBeans will let me import both built-in and third-party libraries, which will speed up the development process. Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are all ideas that Java will allow me to use which will further enhance the software. Java also includes a number of features that will allow me to integrate my product with other software, such as the MySQL Database Management System (DBMS). Because it is a free application that runs on every OS and is exceptionally compatible with NetBeans, this is the best database administration software.\r\n\r\n', 0, 'Computer science ', '[\"Programming / Coding Assignment\"]', 'Diploma', '[\"Computer Science IB board\"]', '2022-02-27', '00:00', '20/02/2022 02:02:42', '20000 rs ', 'Criterion A.docx.pdf_$_', '8', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

(192, 628, 'Final year project(Automatic Waste Segregation)', 'The process starts with customer or user placing waste object in a slot provided in the front \r\nface of the machine and then waste object is sensed with help of sensors and categorized using \r\nflaps which rotate using servomotor. These motors are operated using Arduino which takes input \r\nfrom sensors used for detecting various waste materials one at a time. the sensors used in this \r\nproject are inductive proximity sensors for metal detection and moisture sensor for classification \r\nin dry and wet waste category \r\n When consumer puts waste in the AWS, the sensor gives information to Arduino about \r\npresence of waste in sensing region. Arduino then turns on inductive proximity sensor which \r\nidentifies If the waste is made up of metallic material then sends positive or negative input to \r\nArduino. When a metal target enters the magnetic field created by coil, eddy current circulates \r\nwithin the target. This causes load on the sensor which decreases the oscillatorâ€™s amplitude. As \r\nthe target reaches close to the sensor further the oscillatorâ€™s amplitude decreases, this fluctuation \r\nof oscillator is detected in inductive proximity sensors. If the waste is not detected as metallic \r\nthen another sensor is activated which is moisture sensor, used for sensing moisture content in \r\nthe material to classify waste object as dry & wet waste. Sensor measures moisture content in \r\nthe waste, if the moisture content is above a pre-set threshold value set by manufacturer, then \r\nthe waste is declared as wet waste else it is classified as dry waste. After classification of \r\nwaste as dry, wet & metallic, the input is given to Arduino which is giving input to servomotors \r\nwhich are operating simultaneously to send waste in proper bin assigned for it using two flaps. \r\nOne flap will rotate in X-Y plane and other will rotate in Y-Z plane. Each flap eliminates one \r\nbin at a time, two flaps will eventually eliminate two bins and finally object will be properly \r\nsent to preassigned bin for it. Both flaps will rotate simultaneously with certain time delay to \r\navoid collision between both flaps or to prevent waste from going in the wrong bucket. Time \r\ndelay will be pre mentioned in the coding of Arduino, angle of rotation of each flap will also be \r\nnoted in code. All these values will be calculated pre-fabrication, so that we can design compact \r\nand sophisticated machine. After waste is collected in the bin assigned for it, the ultrasonic \r\nsensors is applied in the bins for detection of level of bins. Ultrasonic sensors work by sending \r\nout a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. The transducer of the sensor \r\nacts as a microphone to receive and send the ultrasonic sound. Ultrasonic sensors like many \r\nothers, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo. The sensor determines \r\nthe distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the \r\n22 / 29\r\nultrasonic pulse. If the distance is less than the threshold distance mentioned by programmer, \r\nthe buzzer will ring notifying the operator that bin is full. Fully filled bins are then removed by \r\noperator and then sent to municipal corporations for further processing such as disposal, recycle \r\nor reuse based on the composition and properties of material used for that particular object, then\r\nempty bins are again placed in the AWS.

This does not include your list of references. \r\no	I really mean 3,000 words as a maximum â€“ there is no +10%!  \r\nâ€¢	While you have some leeway to interpret your chosen question as you see fit, make sure your approach engages with core course material. One major aim of the essay is to gauge the extent to which you have internalized key ideas in readings and lectures. So make sure your essay satisfies this. \r\nâ€¢	Theory is especially important.\r\nâ€¢	Write as if your intended reader was a generally intelligent and informed non-expert. Do not assume key ideas; instead explain them clearly from first principles. If they are crucial, be sure to go in sufficient depth.\r\nâ€¢	Follow appropriate referencing and bibliography. In seeking sources, a useful starting point would be the reading lists provided for this course. A logical next step for deepening your knowledge would be the bibliographies of those works.\r\nâ€¢	The use of a wide variety of relevant academic (ie peer-reviewed) sources is expected. \r\nâ€¢	There is no magic â€˜rightâ€™ number of sources, and quality is preferred over quantity.\r\nâ€¢	Clarity of expression is very important. If English is not your first language, make sure to have your paper proofread by a native speaker.  SBM has a writing tutor â€“ Kyla Sankey, who can help. \r\nâ€¢	Essay structure matters. Make sure your introduction indicates your thesis. Have a plan, make it explicit to the reader, and follow it.\r\nâ€¢	Having a well-articulated thesis statement in your introduction will help to structure your argument and provide a roadmap to the reader. If you are not well-practiced in writing thesis statements, I suggest you seek guidance. SBMâ€™s writing tutor will be helpful.

Max words- 1000. If 1000 words aren\'t enough to include everything mentioned below, then you can go +500, but not more than that. PLEASE WRITE ONLY SUBSTANTIVE STUFF IN THE MOST PROFESSIONAL MANNER.\r\nThis assignment is part of my dissertation so I\'d request your best writer to indulge in it.\r\n\r\nBroad topic: Parents\' involvement in their children\'s sports participation.\r\nResearch question: What are Indian parents\' perceptions of their adolescent athletes\' career trajectory in elite sports? \r\nBasically, what my dissertation will focus on: the psychosocial influences that operate within parents which ultimately contribute to their child\'s career outcome in sports.\r\n\r\nResearch has suggested that parents, rather than teachers/coaches/instructors, are the most influential social factors in childrensâ€™ sports involvement.  \r\nResearch over the years has proved that Sports have much more to offer than what we are currently utilizing. Sports help in building the character and personality of a person, besides being an excellent medium for instilling values like discipline, respect, team spirit, decision making, and keeping depression at bay among many others.\r\nThough it has been established that sport has so many benefits, very few Indian parents involve their kids in sports participation.\r\nAmongst the lot that does as well, there are very few parents who encourage their children to take up a sport as a career (after high school- transitional into college).\r\nWE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES THE PARENTS TAKE THIS DECISION APART FROM THE SOCIAL FACTORS (eg. finances, a sport not being considered a career, low govt funding, sport politics, caste etc)\r\nWE WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE INDIAN SUBCULTURE AFFECTS PARENTS DECISION MAKING ON HOW THEY SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN OR NOT SUPPORT (the psychosocial reasons)\r\nWe will understand this via a theoretical model of parental involvement in sport- Teques & Serpa\'s model which was based on Hoover- Dempsey and Sandler\'s model. You will need to link the theory and parental influences- MOST IMP. \r\nI am attaching four papers that I have read. I will request that you use more papers that are mentioned in their references. Papers by Chris Hardwood are a huge plus point if used.\r\n\r\nOverall, India has a good amount of talented kids playing sports at the sub-elite level. Having said that, this does not show up in high-level tournaments like the Olympics. India has the worst per head medal tally at the Olympics. We want to see how parents play a role in this as they are the most influential models in children\'s sports involvement. Through the lit review, and eventually the paper, I want to try and figure out the parental side of things and how they support their child from moving into elite level sport, that is, choosing a career in sport. And how my study can help understand parents cope with stress and how we can minimize the dropout rates of potentially the next generation of sports athletes and eventually better the medal tally at big tournaments like the Olympics.\r\n', 2, 'Sport psychology', '[\"Literature Review\"]', 'Masters', '[\"Sports, exercise and health science\"]', '2022-04-19', '22:00', '18/04/2022 11:04:49', '1500-2000', 'Parents About Parenting Dual Career Athletes- A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_$_Parental involvement in sport- Psychometric development and empirical test of a theoretical model.pdf_$_Indian sport- Problems and prospects.pdf_$_Elite & Sub-Elite Youth Athletes.pdf_$_', '4', '62', 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0),

This will be one of three broad types:\r\nA.	A primary research based empirical study; \r\nFor this type of project your starting point will typically be from a gap or problem that arises from academic theory.  Your rationale will identify the gap or problem in the theory; your intended audience is likely to be academic and the conclusions will have a more academic and theoretical focus.  \r\nB.	A desk-based project to include a literature review along with further analysis of secondary data;\r\nThis will require you to have access to a suitable existing data set but will not involve the collection of primary data.\r\nC.	An organisation-based research project.\r\nThis type of project has a more practical focus similar to a consultancy type of research.  The research could be for an organisation that you have approached, or could be for the organisation that you work for.  In the past some students have used their research project to undertake research as a foundation for a business enterprise or venture that they are planning.  Your rationale will identify the practical issue or problem which needs addressing and your introduction will provide the context to your organisation. Your intended audience will be practitioners and the conclusions will focus on practical recommendations rather than theoretical developments.  \r\nWhichever form is selected the Research Project report must include a critical review of relevant literature and a critical appraisal of the methodology selected.  \r\nYou will be advised on the most suitable type of project for your topic area during the research methods module and in the initial discussions with your supervisor.\r\n	The structure and style of the project submitted should be appropriate to its intended outcomes. Outlined below are the key stages of tackling a large project.  Your work should include these stages but, depending on the topic of study and the research design, the emphasis between them may vary. \r\nBefore looking at each of the stages in more detail it is vital not to deal with too wide a subject. The more closely the investigation can be defined the better will be the chance of achieving the learning outcomes (and a good mark).  \r\nYou should also note that you are expected to analyse and explain issues associated with the phenomenon being studied, rather than merely describing them. \r\nNormally, the project is written in an impersonal style (ie not using the first person, â€˜Iâ€™). However, where you use certain methodologies it may be permissible to refer to yourself in the first person.\r\n	Aim and Objectives \r\n	State the aim and objectives of your study i.e. what is the purpose of the project. \r\n	State your objectives in such a way that you can measure the extent to which they have been achieved. You may have a proposal (hypothesis) that is capable of being tested or you may have identified a research problem to investigate or a research question to answer. \r\n	Also it is very important to ensure that the aim and objectives defined are achievable within the scope of the research project (timescale, data availability and number of words).\r\n	Introduction and Approach\r\n	The introduction sets the context for the study. This covers the rationale behind the choice of topic and the overall approach to the work and how it is structured.  In other words it includes the justification for your aim and objectives and an overview of how you go about achieving them.  Decide what information is needed to achieve the aim and objectives and how you are going to collect it. Do not include areas that are not related to the topic. \r\n	Review of Theory and Literature Survey\r\n	This stage requires an investigation and discussion of past and current research/literature on your topic. To do this you should read and summarise relevant information on the topic. This literature review must be used to develop a theoretical framework for your work. It will vary according to the type of study that you are undertaking. However, an apparent lack of literature probably means that the topic is unsuitable for a research project. \r\n	The role of the literature survey can be summarised as follows:\r\nâ€¢	To help further clarify the purpose of your research and contribute to a rationale for the work.\r\nâ€¢	Provide a thorough examination of the relevant literature, so giving you a full understanding of the topic.\r\nâ€¢	Clearly identify and define the theoretical concepts and/or frameworks to be used in the work.\r\nâ€¢	To provide a context for your research by placing your specific topic in the literature and showing how your work relates to that already existing.\r\nâ€¢	Identify and analyse the relationships between ideas that make up the framework for your study.\r\nâ€¢	Provide a basis for your methodological choices\r\n\r\nIn order to do this it is necessary to look for and summarise areas of agreement and disagreement and contradictory evidence and analyse and evaluate theory and evidence with reference to the objectives of your study. \r\nA literature review should be comprehensive, current, critical and clearly focused on your objectives. It should cover the full range of literature available that relates to your topic. It is a requirement of a literature review that you use academic and research literature from journals, books, papers and government publications. Online research databases such as â€˜Discoverâ€™ provided by the library will enable you to search a wide variety of sources relatively easily.\r\nFollow the guidelines on referencing for the Leeds Beckett Harvard system. Also, wherever possible, you should refer to work read rather than overuse direct quotations (ask your supervisor if you are still unsure about the difference between direct and indirect quoting or paraphrasing). Also see the section on referencing below.\r\nAt this stage of the process your objectives will probably undergo some refinement or your research problem/question(s) will become more precise.\r\nOne of the key challenges of the research project is to produce a coherent and holistic piece of work in which all the sections link together and are clearly focused on the aim and objectives. This is obviously important throughout but especially so in establishing the relationship between the literature review and any primary research or secondary data analysis undertaken.\r\nThis should be discussed in detail with your supervisor but the basic principles are that:\r\nâ€¢	Your literature review is concluded effectively and you are clear about the findings and how they relate to the aims and objectives.\r\nâ€¢	The findings of your literature review are clearly and explicitly used to inform the methodology and, hence, the primary research.\r\nâ€¢	The data sought from the primary research is properly identified and is derived from and related to the literature review findings. \r\nâ€¢	The methods used to carry out the research are appropriate and relevant to the findings of the literature review and the data sought. \r\n\r\nResearch Design and Methodology\r\nIt is important to develop an effective methodology and to understand why your methodology is appropriate to this particular study. Consideration should therefore be given to the best methods to use to address the research problem or question that you have identified.\r\nYour method will vary with the type of study, but you will probably need to collect or locate data and analyse them.  This may well involve you in primary research (collecting data for the specific purposes of your project).  It does not, however, have to take this form. It may be possible to use existing data in a way that is new to this study.\r\nIt is expected that you will deal with the following elements in this stage of the research project:\r\nâ€¢	The specific purpose of this part of the process and how it contributes to the overall aims and objectives of the work.\r\nâ€¢	The choice of research approach (primary/secondary â€“ qualitative/quantitative).\r\nâ€¢	The choice of sample â€“ size, characteristics and selection method.\r\nâ€¢	If using primary data the methods used to collect the data and the precise design of any instruments used (interview schedules, questionnaires, observation checklists etc.).\r\nâ€¢	If using secondary data a critique of the collection method and awareness of any limitations\r\nâ€¢	Techniques used to analyse the data (again qualitative or quantitative).\r\nâ€¢	Critical evaluation of each of these factors.\r\nThe research methods module will have introduced a variety of data gathering techniques and associated means of analysis.  It is important that you are able to honestly criticise the methodology you have used, in the light of the outcomes and your original objectives. For example, how reliable and/or valid are the results? Are the measurements accurate? Is there any bias? etc. No research is perfect and the ability to reflect on your own research practice is an important part of becoming a good researcher.\r\n\r\nWHATEVER METHOD YOU ADOPT, YOU MUST NOT APPROACH ANY OUTSIDE BODY OR SEND OUT ANY POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRES UNLESS THE ETHICS COORDINATOR AND YOUR SUPERVISOR HAVE GIVEN PERMISSION AND YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL THE NECESSARY ETHICS FORMS (AVAILABLE VIA Leeds Beckett Ethics Online). \r\nThis requirement applies equally to interviews with members of the public (such as street interviews) as to any other form of data gathering. These individuals may be contacted by tutors, as a means of verifying the data you attribute to them.  If potential participants wish to retain anonymity, you must explain to them that their identity will only be shared with tutors.\r\nPrimary Research Requirements\r\nPast experience has shown that the majority of students elect to undertake some form of primary research. This helps to support/test the findings of their reading and to draw effective and realistic conclusions for their work. \r\nWhen carrying out research it is vital that you conduct it professionally and ethically. \r\nVerification: In the past we have had some students who have been unable to verify the source(s) of their data or the way in which it was collected. As a result of this you MUST meet the requirements outlined below. \r\nAlthough this detail may not be presented in your research project due to issues of confidentiality and anonymity you must make sure that you keep records of the following in line with the Universityâ€™s research ethics policy. \r\n\r\n1.	Records of all sources of data.\r\n2.	Identify your sources including as much of the following information as possible;\r\nâ€¢	Name and addresses of individuals contacted.\r\nâ€¢	Their position within the organisation.\r\nâ€¢	The address of the organisation head office\r\nâ€¢	Dates & times of contacts.\r\n3.	Signed consent forms\r\n4.	The use of questionnaires carried out on a random basis in the street is usually discouraged in the project. Your supervisor is likely to ask you to look for alternative methods if you are considering this as an approach. If you do use this approach you must still collect as much of the data as possible from each respondent.\r\n\r\nIt is the intention of staff involved in the research project to follow up a random sample of primary research to confirm the information presented is accurate.\r\nEthics: the Universityâ€™s policy on research ethics is quite clear. All research should conform to some basic principles:\r\n1.	Beneficence â€“ â€˜do positive goodâ€™ and\r\n2.	Non-maleficence â€“ â€˜do no harmâ€™\r\n	The research should be assessed for potential risks concerning participants â€“ the interests of subjects and participants in the research should always come before those of the research itself.\r\n3.	Informed consent of participants\r\n	All participants should be given full and accurate information in order for them to decide whether to take part in the research or not. Example of Information sheet can be found on MyBeckett. \r\n4.	Confidentiality & anonymity\r\n	Explicit consent must be gained from participants in order to publish any information that may enable them to be identified. Examples of Consent forms can be found on MyBeckett. \r\n	(if the research involves a questionnaire then the consent form can be built into this, rather than requiring  a separate consent form)\r\nPlease refer to the separate guidance on â€œEthical clearance for research undertaken by studentsâ€ and submit the appropriate forms online as indicated via your MyBeckett module. \r\nClick here to submit your research ethics forms online https://researchethics.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/auth?redirect=%2F \r\nETHICS FORMS MUST BE SUBMITTED AND APPROVED BEFORE ANY PRIMARY RESEARCH IS UNDERTAKEN. WE RECOMMEND THIS IS DONE AT LEAST EIGHT WEEKS BEFORE YOUR SUBMISSION DATE.\r\nAny student without final ethics approval performing primary research or submitting work that includes primary research will be subject to investigation for unfair practice under the University Academic Regulations Section 10: Academic Integrity.\r\nBefore you begin your research; whether using primary sources (human subjects such as consumers, event managers, company employees etc.) or secondary sources (TripAdvisor comments, newspapers or company websites etc.) you must complete your Research Ethics forms online, have your Research Ethics forms approved by your supervisor and then approved by the Local Research Ethics Coordinator\r\nPlease read the Leeds Beckett University Research Policy https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/-/media/files/policies/research-and-enterprise/upre_research_ethics_policy.pdf\r\nData Presentation, Analysis and Discussion\r\nPresent the data professionally, logically and clearly. There are two different methods suggested for this; either present your main findings separate from any analysis or discussion, or present your findings and discussion together. \r\nAs a general guideline it is likely that the former will be more appropriate for quantitative data and the latter for qualitative data. This is a guide not a rule you must follow, there will always be instances when either approach is appropriate. Make sure you discuss this with your supervisor.\r\nThe form of data analysis undertaken will vary according to how the project has been approached. Thus some research projects may involve highly quantitative analysis whereas others may utilise qualitative methods.  The research methods programme will introduce you to various data analysis techniques.  \r\nThe analysis needs to be appropriate for the study. For example, simple descriptive analysis may be acceptable in some instances but more sophisticated inferential analysis may be more appropriate and improve the quality of your findings. However you need to plan this in advance as collection of the wrong or insufficient data will make it difficult or impossible to conduct the required level of analysis. \r\nDiscussion of the significance of your results should consider:\r\nâ€¢	comparisons with similar research and findings in the literature;\r\nâ€¢	to what extent the data confirms or detracts from any theoretical framework developed in the literature review and/or used in your research;\r\nâ€¢	whether your data collection methods may have affected the results;\r\nâ€¢	practical and theoretical implications for firms, management, government bodies etc.\r\nThis section gives you the opportunity to evaluate your findings in context and thereby demonstrate your skills of evaluation, analysis and synthesis.\r\nConclusions and Recommendations\r\nConclusions (and possibly recommendations) are the final part of your work. They should follow naturally from the work done to this point and should summarise the key issues emerging from your work and set it in a wider context.  Is it possible, for example, to generalise on the basis of your findings? You conclusion should do this without bringing in any new arguments. Keep it concise and focused on the implications of your findings. \r\nDepending on the nature of the subject matter, you may wish to offer recommendations. These may be for the industry in terms of future action or for researchers considering a similar topic. \r\nIt is appropriate for you to suggest other, related, avenues for further consideration. This is not an afterthought to be tacked on to the end of the research project; it is a key element of the work that should not be left to the last minute. \r\nReferences \r\nAll sources of information to which you refer must be cited using the Harvard referencing convention. You should already be fully conversant with this style; if not full guidelines are available in the library or on the intranet.  \r\nThe reference list should not be a general list of publications on the topic. Only include those references to which you refer in the text, do not include sources read but not directly referred to.\r\nLast word\r\nThe better projects do not merely follow a linear process and are not a â€˜diaryâ€™ of what you did. The finished written work represents a completed solution to (or recommendations for) an identified problem. This means that you will revisit all sections of the written work throughout the module possibly revising your aim and objectives at the end of the process. With this in mind do not use the future tense but write as though you have completed the work. Past or present tense is appropriate.\r\n4.2.2	Further Assessment Details\r\nAssessment for the research project is based on the final completed thesis.\r\nYou will have had guidance about how to write your proposal for the Project within Research Methods. \r\nOnce proposals have been submitted they will usually be reviewed by the Course Research Project Co-ordinator and any appropriate colleagues for context specific elements. After reviewing your proposal you will be allocated a supervisor.\r\nYou must make arrangements to discuss with them immediately to start the research process. Where the proposal has not been passed you may be required to make changes before you start on your research. \r\nThe proposed title may change during the course of the work as might the methods employed or even the specific objectives. \r\nChanging topics part way through will severely limit the time available and you are unlikely to achieve the necessary standard of work.  Any request for alteration of the topic must be channelled through your Supervisor to the Course Research Project Co-ordinator.\r\nAssessment of the research project will be based on the criteria listed later in this section.  Each project will be double marked (supervisor plus one other member of staff) and the final mark may be the subject of scrutiny by the external examiner. \r\nThere may also be a confirmatory viva voce (interview) if necessary.\r\n\r\n4.2.3	Guidance on formatting your Masters Research Project\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Typing should be one and a half line-spaced, except for extended quotations, which should be single-spaced and indented. \r\nâ€¢	The left-hand margin should be a minimum of 40mm, and the remaining margins should be at least 20mm. \r\nâ€¢	The font should be 12 point except for headings and titles. \r\nâ€¢	Typing can be double sided.  \r\nâ€¢	All pages should be numbered.\r\n\r\nAt the front of the project there should be:\r\na)	a title page giving: \r\nï±	the title of the research project, which should give a clear indication of the content\r\nï±	your name\r\nï±	the name of your course, for example  â€œMSc International Events Management\" \r\nï±	the words â€œLeeds Beckett Universityâ€\r\nï±	the month and year of submission\r\n\r\n\r\nExample: 					   Title\r\nName\r\nPresented as part of the requirement for the award of the\r\nMSc/MA in â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.\r\nLeeds Beckett University\r\nMonth, Year\r\n\r\na)	a declaration page with the wording:\r\nI, â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” confirm that the work contained in this research project is my own work. It has not been previously published or submitted for assessment elsewhere.\r\nI confirm that all other sources of information have been acknowledged in line with the regulations for referencing.\r\nI confirm that I have fully complied with all University regulations regarding plagiarism and unfair practice.\r\nI confirm that the word count for the dissertation is XXXX\r\nName:    \r\nSignature:    ____________________ Date: ____________\r\n\r\nb)	an acknowledgements/dedications page (if desired).\r\nc)	an abstract of approximately 250 words outlining the main arguments\r\nd)	a contents page listing the page numbers of all sections/chapters \r\nand including , if appropriate\r\n-	a list of tables \r\n-	a list of figures, including maps, diagrams, photographs, etc.\r\ne)	a list of appendices (to include evidence of ethical approval).\r\n\r\nThe nature of the content will inevitably vary depending upon the individual study.  However, each project should normally include:\r\nï±	a background to the issue, explaining why it is important;\r\nï±	a clear statement of the research problem;\r\nï±	a review of relevant literature;\r\nï±	details of the methodology used;\r\nï±	the findings;\r\nï±	analysis and interpretation;\r\nï±	conclusions and recommendations or implications (possibly for theory, practice, policy, further research)\r\nï±	A bibliography of references (in Harvard style and only those you have referred to in the text.)\r\n\r\n	Numbering of pages begins with the Introduction to the report itself and not with the Title page, Acknowledgements and Contents. These pages are known as â€œPrelimsâ€ and if numbered should be given a different numbering from the main text e.g. (i) (ii) (iii) etc.  (The title page should not be numbered.) Numbering should be at the bottom centre of each page.\r\nThe length of the research project should be a maximum of 14,000 words (excluding appendices). The word count starts at your introduction and finishes after your recommendations\r\n\r\n	It is considered part of the discipline of the Research Project to work within this word limit.  Please pay attention to the maximum word-length for your assignment. You will not be penalised if you go slightly over the limit (up to 10%) but learning to write concisely is part of the discipline of producing a good, focussed essay or report. If your assignment is over-long we will not mark it and your work will be recorded as a non-submission.  Appendices should be used sparingly, essential information should be included within the word count as content in the appendices is not assessed.  The word limit excludes the list of references, appendices and assignment cover sheets.â€\r\n\r\nThe criteria for assessing the project are identified in Appendix B.  Your research project will, therefore, be assessed on the extent to which it demonstrates:\r\nâ€¢	The clarity of the rationale and focus. The level of internal consistency and the logical development of information to sustain arguments linking the research rationale, literature and findings indicating a high level of critical awareness of strengths and limitations of the research. Clarity of analysis and evaluation;\r\nâ€¢	A comprehensive literature research and/or study of background information consistent with the stated aim of the research project;\r\nâ€¢	An advanced understanding of the conceptual and theoretical perspectives and appreciation of methodological issues related to the research topic and has constructively criticised all major viewpoints illustrating awareness of strengths and limitations;\r\nâ€¢	That the analysis and/or discussion of the collected data or information is logically sound and is relevant to an evaluation of any hypothesis offered and the degree to which the aims have been fulfilled;\r\nâ€¢	That the presentation of the research project is in the approved manner with reference to format, argument, statistical information and analysis, appendices and referencing;\r\nâ€¢	The project is demonstrably the student\'s own work.\r\n\r\nKeeping in contact with your supervisor provides you with an opportunity to ensure that you are approaching your project in a manner that will increase your likelihood of meeting the assessment criteria.\r\n\r\nStudent Instructions for Submission of Coursework \r\nThis module requires you to submit your work online.\r\nYou MUST submit your work through MyBeckett using the link set up by the tutor. Receipt of your work will be recorded.\r\nYour \"Turnitin assignments\" in MyBeckett can be set up so that you can check your assignment yourself as you submit it. This checking is done by creating a \"Similarity Report\".  If this report shows that there are some problems with your work, such as un-cited quotations, you should be able to make corrections and re-submit the work again before the due date. More information about Turnitin is available online here: http://libguides.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/mybeckett/turnitin\r\n\r\nPlease note: Tutors will follow up any suspected breach of academic integrity found after the submission date as per University policy. Late penalties will apply as per University Regulations.\r\n\r\nParticular Instructions to Students\r\nPlease read carefully the assessment and grade/marking descriptors overleaf:\r\n \r\nCourse Title(s): 	MSc International Events Management / MSc Sports Events Management / MSc Responsible Tourism Management / MSc Experiential Event Marketing\r\nModule Title:	Masters Research Project	Level:	7\r\nAssessment Title:	Masters Research Project	Weighting: 	100%\r\n\r\nCriteria and Weighting	100-70\r\nExcellent	69-60 \r\nGood	59-50\r\nSatisfactory	49-40\r\nPoor	39-0\r\nFail\r\nRationale, aims and objectives\r\n\r\n	Excellently articulated and evidenced rationale, background & context.\r\nA novel and legitimate aim with appropriate objectives detailing what will be achieved	Rationale, background & context very clear and evidenced through reference to a range of sources.\r\nA clear aim and appropriate objectives 	Rationale, background & context clear and evidenced through reference to a range of sources.\r\nAim detailed with achievable objectives	Rationale, background & context included but lacking clarity/purpose.

Edit the draft for wordiness. Take a critical look at each sentence and trim out as many words as you can without losing the meaning. Wordy sentences contain many unnecessary words. These sentences feel â€œwatered downâ€â€”like you have to do a lot of work to gain a little information.\r\n\r\nGood writing is dense and concise; the words in the sentence work hard. Consider the following revisions:\r\n\r\nWordy: A few inches of snow on the ground is all that is necessary in order for a person to be able to go sledding.\r\n\r\nBetter: A few inches of snow is necessary to go sledding.\r\n\r\nWordy: All of the students who are new to this school are required to attend a meeting that has been scheduled for Friday the 22nd of September.\r\n\r\nBetter: New students are required to attend a meeting on Friday, September 22. \r\n\r\nNote: The problem with wordiness is not about the quantity of words; there is nothing wrong with a sentence having 25 or even 75 words as long as those words add information and detail. When reducing wordiness, be careful not to kill the richness and expressiveness of your writing.\r\n\r\nNot wordy: A bird with crimson wings glided from the jungle canopy and landed gracefully on a nearby rock.\r\n\r\nNot better: A bird flew from the trees to a rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Edit the draft for vague language. Look critically at your word choices and ask: Can I think of a more specific word for this?\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine you\'ve written a sentence like this: \"In society, we often create interpersonal relationships with people who resonate with our values.\" Underlined are words that could definitely be more specific. Does the author mean society or 21st century America? Does he mean interpersonal relationships or friendships or love affairs or workplace collaborations? \r\n\r\nIf you can\'t get more specific, that\'s okay. But make sure you\'re using words like humans for a reason. Here are some usual suspects when it comes to vague language: They, Those, People, A Person, Individuals, Humans, Adults, Society, We, Us, One, Someone, Everybody, Anyone, Human Beings, Civilians, Citizens, Many, Early, Most, Others, Things, Stuff, Certain, Aspects, etc.\r\n\r\n3. See if you can do something about your overuse of the verb \"to be\" (is, am, was, etc.)\r\n\r\nI have a tendency to write with an abundance of these verbs:\r\n\r\nIt was morning when Jolene stepped into the forest. The sunlight and thick branches were above her, and wildflowers were by the trunks of the trees. There were many critters on the dirt road. This place was Joleneâ€™s favorite spot whenever she wanted time alone.\r\n\r\nBut through revision (with an emphasis on strong verbs) you can vary the language:\r\n\r\nAt morning, Jolene stepped into the forest. Sunlight shone down on thick branches, and wildflowers grew near the trunks of the trees. Critters scampered along the dirt road. Whenever Jolene wanted time alone, she came here.\r\n\r\n4. Do a search in your document for \"ly.\" This will help you track down most of your adverbs: \"quickly,\" \"urgently,\" \"desperately,\" etc. Typically eliminating adverbs and making your verbs stronger can help you reduce wordiness, vary language, and do all that other good stuff.\r\n\r\nBefore: \"He ran quickly.\"\r\n\r\nAfter: \"He bolted.\"\r\n\r\nSee? One word instead of two -- without losing meaning. Also \"bolted\" is a lot more specific and less mundane: excitement in writing.\r\n\r\n5. Add more in the way of analysis. After each quotation, you are meant to (1) make some original contribution and (2) connect the quotation\'s claim to your topic sentence.  \r\n\r\nLook to the passages of text that follow any quotation. Ask yourself critically: Have I said anything new here? Or am I merely repeating the ideas in the quotation? Try discussing what the author has neglected to consider in his/her/their quotation. Think up ways to take the argument further. Discuss unforeseen consequences and/or benefits. \r\n\r\nIf you attempted to \"get done\" with your analysis in one quick sentence, that won\'t do.

What is the gap your research will fill? Why is it an important topic? It should not just describe other relevant research but analyse and integrate existing work to help you frame and justify your topic, your research question, or the issue you want to explore, or the hypothesis you want to test. The literature review enables you to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the topic and should make up a significant chunk of your\r\nproposal. It also allows you to explain some of the key concepts and related studies in more depth.\r\nThe methodology section discusses how you wish to answer your research questions and hypotheses if applicable. If doing a qualitative research project, you will be identifying the phenomenon or issue you wish to investigate. You should discuss and justify the different methods you wish to employ for collecting and analysing data. Information about the sample being used and why you feel this is a good sample should also be included. Additional marks are available for examples of research instruments such as a sample questionnaire or set of interview questions, as well as some basic understanding of what analysis techniques may be useful.

Once each trial was completed, the average time taken (seconds) to select the colour of the words in the list was recorded.\r\n\r\nDemographic data about the participants, as well as the average time taken to complete each trial, has been provided above. \r\n\r\nTo begin, you should review all of the results you are going to use and open an SPSS file. Next, you will need to input the data from the above table into a new dataset.\r\nYou will need to organise your data on the basis of their type (such as ordinal, nominal, etc.) and process your data accordingly and on the basis of what you have learned in the units.\r\nAnalyse your data by checking your Distribution and run any necessary Normality Tests.\r\nAnalyse Descriptive Statistics for all Trials.\r\nCompare the means between the following Trials using the appropriate t-test:\r\nA. Neutral (Trial 1) and Snake (Trial 3)\r\nB. Neutral (Trial 1) and Pain (Trial 7)\r\nC. Neutral (Trial 1) and Defeat (Trial 9)\r\nReport all your data on the basis of the APA style.\r\nReview the literature on the Emotional Stroop Test and start thinking about your own findings.\r\nInterpret your findings.\r\nWrite up your research report.\r\nWhat should I include in my report? \r\nYou will write up your findings in the conventional scientific report style with American Psychological Association referencing. Details of how these reports should be written can be found here. \r\n\r\nThe research report should reflect the following parts:\r\n\r\nAbstract â€“ approx 150 words\r\nIntroduction â€“ approx 1000 words which addressed the background theory and research on the Emotional Stroop test, the aim and the hypotheses of the study.\r\nMethods on the basis of the APA style. Please include any ethical considerations for this study. \r\nResults â€“ tables should be included using APA style â€“ the data should then be reported\r\nDiscussion - approx 1000 words which explains conclusions regarding the Emotional Stroop Test based on the research and the results of the t-test. The discussion should also suggest what could be done to further this study and explain why your suggestions would be valuable in the field.\r\nReferences â€“ use APA style\r\nAppendices â€“ include SPSS outputs\r\nAll sources should be cited using the APA style, and you should remember to discuss the theory and research of the Emotional Stroop Test, as well as describe and evaluate your findings in relationship to the theory and studies on the Emotional Stroop Test.\r\n\r\nPlease fully state and justify any other assumptions or choices that you make using the suggested resources of this unit, as well as your own research.

You will need to develop a Strategic Position Plan (SPP) for that product. To do this, you will need to apply the Ansoff Matrix and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix to this product by critically analysing the strategic actions the firm should take to allow that product to survive or to grow. The context is that you have been asked to evaluate the Strategic Plan of the firm and have been given the task of focussing, in the first instance, on the major product of the firm or any other select product (or service).\r\n \r\nSpecifically, you need to:\r\n \r\nIntroduce the firm\r\nIntroduce the product\r\nExplain and justify where the product currently â€œsitsâ€ on the Ansoff matrix\r\nExplain and justify where the product currently â€œsitsâ€ on the BCG matrix\r\nPresent a Strategic Position Plan (SPP) for the product that includes:\r\n- What the firm should do with that product in terms of geographical target markets (e.g. stay in-country, go overseas, etc.) to survive or to grow (only one) and justify your response\r\n- What the firm should do with that product in terms of pricing strategy to survive or to grow (only one) (e.g. cost leadership, differentiation, other)\r\n- A map of competitors in the chosen geographic market and price range, their strengths and setbacks, and how you will deal with them', 2, 'Mba', '[\"Essay Writing\",\"Report Writing\",\"PPT Making\"]', 'Masters', '[\"Strategic management\"]', '2022-10-20', '12:00', '18/10/2022 04:10:31', '3900', 'Pronto Parking Case Study for A3 Quiz.pptx_$_', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0),

There is no one right or definitive answer to a case question. However, a student should not conclude that there are no wrong answers. Case responses differ because of differing identification of issues and analysis of relations among issues, differing determinations of what the root or underlying issues are, and differing development of recommendations to resolve the root issues and, in turn, the other issues. Although a variety of responses are valid at every stage, some, clearly, are incorrect. The case response format is not fixed; typically it depends on the case question. However, using a simple, standardized form will improve case responses and provide a context for unambiguous marking. It is recommended that students use the issue analyses-recommendations framework, deciding for themselves, according to the particular case, whether to use the three headings or to combine the first and second or the second and third. The three parts are described and analyzed below.\r\nIssues\r\nProblems or issues are those attributes, factors, and/or activities that are wrong with the organization.\r\nStudents should read a case question once or twice to gather its essence. While reading, it is helpful to identify the issues by circling or highlighting them or by taking notes. Then, the student reviews these identified issues, adding to them any issues revealed by related analysis of financial statements and other supplementary information supplied.\r\nIn order to \"size up\" the root issues, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the organization and its issues. This analysis can be accomplished in two steps. First, make a list of the issues. Arrange and assemble similar issues into groups. Explain the relationships among the groups or categories that emerge at this stage. The groupings should be governed by two criteria.\r\nFirst, same or related issues should be grouped together; for example, all issues related to inaccurate financial information would go into one group. Second, associations among issues within a group should be specified; for example, inaccurate accounting information led to poor decisions on inventory orders.\r\nSecond, the relationship among the categories must be explained. This explanation should reveal the root issues. Once they are disclosed, the root issues should be linked in a logical sequence. This listing should show the dependent relationship between the other issues and their root issues. Care should be taken to account for any specific requests that arise because of the role assigned to the student. The request may specify the perspective the student takes in assessing the issues. Requests may also be understood as additional issues.\r\n\r\n The primary reason for grouping and ranking issues is to detect the underlying pattern of root issues. Sometimes, issues may also be the same as the root issues. In others, the detection may be more difficult. For example, consider a manufacturing firm with several problems: sales are not growing as expected; customers are returning products; customer satisfaction with the product quality is declining; and rework has increased. The root issue, lack of quality control, causes the other issues. Specifically, there was no quality control in the production process. The absence of quality control led to more rework and to the shipping of defective products, which the customers then returned or refused to buy again, and persuaded others not to buy.\r\nIt is identification of the root issues that enables the student to specify succinctly what is wrong with an organization. Proper identification requires close reading of the entire case, including appendices. Some information may have little or no bearing on the issues. As in the real-life situations that case analysis seeks to emulate, the student must sift carefully through all discernible aspects of a situation in order to determine what is relevant.\r\nAnalysis\r\nAnalysis and issue identification are highly related. Analysis requires a thorough assessment of why an issue arose or exists, how various issues relate to each other, and which issues lead to others and are, therefore, the most crucial to an under standing of the root issues. The analysis section includes required quantitative analysis, e.g., cost-volume-profit variance analysis. The analysis discloses how well essential organizational functions are working, e.g., planning, controlling, and management information systems. Analysis can also reveal, when necessary, the strengths and weaknesses of the organization. The analysis may vary in complexity. It can be as simple as listing the supporting issues, or as complex as finding the root or underlying issues.\r\nSome case questions have a singular answer either because of the context or because of the \"required\". Other case questions lend themselves to a series of alternatives for solving issues. Alternatives should be individually meaningful and mutually exclusive. For example, for a business with serious profit problems, one alternative might be to reduce costs and focus on the core business. Another alternative might be to close the business and sell the assets and inventories. Each alternative must be explained and justified as an answer, and if appropriate, its advantages and disadvantages should be discussed.\r\nRecommendations\r\nThe recommendations are a student\'s approach to remedying the root issues. If there are alternatives, the recommendations should be selected from the alternatives discussed in the analysis section. In resolving the root issues, the recommendations must also resolve most of the other issues. Recommendations should be action oriented, decisive and unambiguous; i.e., they should explicitly resolve the issues, assign responsibilities and set deadlines.\r\nIt may be suitable to include a conclusion that deals with implementation, especially with timing, and the assignment of responsibilities that arise out of the recommendations.\r\nFor example, with respect to the organization with profit problems, a student might recommend cost cutting and focus on the core business alternative. The student should follow the selection of this alternative by specifying how he or she would resolve the profit problems, and by suggesting an implementation plan. The implementation should detail which costs are to be cut, by whom, and with what consequences. It should detail which businesses are to be eliminated\r\n\r\n and which ones are to remain. If sufficient information is available, the recommendations should be quantified, showing the expected profit improvement.\r\nIn the report writing stage, it is often more time efficient and effective to identify, analyze, and make recommendations for each root issue individually. It is nevertheless essential to show the integration of the various issues within the case. Whatever the approach, it should be justified as the most appropriate for the case question.\r\nUse of Turnitin\r\nTo uphold academic integrity, Turnitin will be used in this assessment. By submitting your work through Turnitin, Turnitin\'s software will compare your work against a repository of internet and library resources in addition to the work of your peers and other academics to generate a similarity report. This similarity report verifies that your work is your own and that any referenced material is appropriately cited.\r\nSubmission\r\nStudents should save their excel file as one PDF file for the instructor to mark. Save this PDF document according to the naming convention: GroupNameAssignment.pdf. Include the names of all group members on the first page of the PDF. Then, one member of the group needs to submit your assessment on behalf of all group members electronically to the Turnitin submission inbox at the bottom (Part 1).\r\nClick the \"Part 2\" tab at the top of the Turnitin Assignment to submit your excel file to show the calculations.\r\nAll course work submitted will require students in the course to complete and submit the academic integrity checklist. Please download the academic integrity checklist on the Assessment page and have one group member upload it under \"Academic Integrity Checklist\" tab at the top.\r\nNOTE: Assignments will be considered incomplete if they do not include the required academic integrity checklist.\r\nIt is your responsibility to verify if the submission was successful. Be sure to keep a backup copy of all your assignments in the event that they are lost in transition.\r\n', 2, 'Accounting', '[\"Report Writing\",\"Case Studies\"]', 'Diploma', '[\"Management & Cost accounting\"]', '2022-10-25', '21:45', '21/10/2022 12:10:31', '4200', 'C90BE42D-CB43-4DC6-8DDE-4228F9D73B58.jpeg_$_', '4', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0),

Using research, identify the primary conflict drivers, key sources of insecurity, key stakeholders and their interests, and the interventions that have occurred or are occurring to keep and/or build peace. Apply the concepts and literature discussed in Weeks 1-6 to discuss the relevance of the security-development nexus in the context of this case study. This is a critical summary and assessment of the dynamics underpinning a particular conflict case study. You should engage with the course material to help you understand your case and clearly articulate your assessment (which is also your argument) of the conflict. Your conflict assessment should include the following:\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Introduce the conflict case study you have selected, and summarize your assessment into a clear and concise argument (you can think of this like a thesis statement â€“ it is a declarative articulation of the central argument being made in your conflict assessment) (e.g. â€˜While whole-of-government approaches have been attempted in in this context, interventions have failed to address one of the primary conflict drivers, thereby excluding a key stakeholder for peacebuilding). Answer the â€œso what?â€ of your assessment (e.g. The ongoing conflict in this context has led to mass migration, disruption of livelihoods, and has exacerbated the economic challenges this region faces. Failure to address this important conflict driver and include this key stakeholder in resolution efforts, risks this conflict becoming intractable).\r\n\r\nConflict Drivers: Identify and briefly explain the causes of conflict and the primary grievances that have led to violence in this context. Who are the key players? What are they disputing? Are external actors involved? Etc.\r\n\r\nSources of Insecurity: How is the conflict impacting civilians? What are the primary results of the violence? (e.g. economic precarity, displacement, sexual and gender based violence, genocide, political marginalization, etc.)\r\n\r\nKey Stakeholders and their Interests: In this section, detail who has interests in the conflict or who may be impacted by how the conflict plays out. This is not the warring parties (as these should be discussed in the Conflict Drivers section), but is rather about what other actors may impact or be impacted by how the conflict plays out in your case study context. These may include international actors, transnational forces, corporations, non-state groups, political parties,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nInterventions: Overview the types of peace-related interventions that have taken place in your case study. Have those interventions been successful or faced serious challenges? Have those interventions employed efforts at policy coherence by combining or harmonizing security and development? Based on your assessment of the conflict dynamics, what is missing from the interventions that have been tried or are being tried?', 3, 'Social Science', '[\"Essay Writing\"]', 'Bachelors', '[\"Social Science\"]', '2022-11-01', '12:00', '24/10/2022 07:10:01', '3000', 'Midterm Assignment - Conflict Assessment.pdf_$_', '13', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0),

The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.\r\n\r\nEdgar F. Codd, the inventor of the relational model (RM), introduced the concept of normalization and what we now know as the First normal form (1NF) in 1970.

Your report should demonstrate wide reading and comprehension of the theoretical frameworks introduced in the module. You are expected to draw on key concepts and frameworks to analyse the process of launching new ventures. Good reports will draw on theoretical concepts to show understanding of the challenges typically encountered when creating a new venture. This may include frameworks explaining the influence of uncertainty and related knowledge problems on new ventures; strategies for creating new firms, the foundersâ€™ role, and how entrepreneurs can overcome challenges such as resource dependency and liabilities of newness/scale.\r\n\r\nPart 2: A Self-reflection (30%)  Written in the first person (I) this part of the report should demonstrate your personal understanding of the process of creating a new venture. You do not need to draw on theoretical frameworks in Part 2. Instead, you can draw on previous entrepreneurial experiences (e.g., founding your own firm, working for start-ups, entrepreneurial competitions (e.g., Ingenuity) internships, family business etc). It may also be helpful to draw on your experiences during this module. For example, what insights did you gain from designing a Business Model for a new venture? What might you do differently? Finally, you may project into the future to consider how you would approach the process of launching a new venture. Have you gained any insights from this module that you would use in the future if you were creating your own venture or joining a start-up?\r\n\r\nSome key points to consider:\r\n\r\n1)   The individual report requires two parts: Part 1 is a standard academic essay with references, introduction, discussion, and conclusion. Part 2 is a self-reflection written in the first person (I) and based on your personal understanding of the process of launching a new venture.\r\n\r\n2)   A marking rubric for the individual report is provided on Moodle.  Summarising from the rubric, a good report must demonstrate the following:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding of theoretical frameworks introduced during the module to explain the process of launching new ventures;\r\nA clear explanation of what business models are and why they are relevant for launching new ventures;\r\nEvidence of comprehension based on high quality and wide ranging referencing of literature included in the reading list;\r\nSelf-reflection showing personal understanding of the process of launching a new venture.\r\nWell structured, rigorous and logical report.\r\nWord count specified is to be strictly adhered to.

As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place.\r\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience.

Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\r\nCompany D: Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable.

Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another â€“ thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth.

It should include a title page, contents page, page numbers, and a clear system of appropriate headings and sub- headings.\r\nElement 2 â€“ Reflective statement on the research process\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper requires you to find, evaluate and use information drawn from a range of academic and practitioner sources. The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\r\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\r\nÂ§ How did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\r\nÂ§ What did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\r\nÂ§ How might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\r\nThe reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as\r\na separate document.\r\n\r\nFor more read file attached below', 2, 'Bba', '[\"Report Writing\",\"Research Paper\"]', 'Bachelors', '[\"Marketing Communication\"]', '2023-02-12', '03:01', '06/02/2023 20:02:02', '4000', 'Marketing communication final assignment.pdf_$_', '15', NULL, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),

With reference to neuroscientific research, discuss whether inductive and deductive reasoning processes are supported by different brain regions.  This essay title requires searching the literature and identifying brain regions involved in the reasoning processes. These results should then be compared against each other in order to address the essay title.

Discuss how the remote associates test provides insights into insight problem solving as well as retrieval from semantic memory.  This essay title requires demonstrating your ability to analyse a particular cognitive task. It should show your understanding of what makes a test one that requires problem solving, requires insight, and requires memory retrieval.

Easygoing denim pants</h2> Denims are timeless. With every new season there comes a new denim trend but denim never goes out of trend. Although slim fit denim is every girlâ€™s favourite but I recommend to have denim pants of all colour and all patterns. Say for example one should have straight fit, flared pants, boyfriend jeans, mom jeans, bell bottoms, etc. A denim for every mood! <br> <br> <h2>2. Little black dress </h2> The iconic LBD. If thereâ€™s one thing Coco Chanel gave us that nobody will ever forget is not the fragrance thatâ€™s so well known but the little black dress. A black dress can be worn at multiple times and it can look different each time. Wear it with sport shoes for a casual look, add a statement belt and black heels for a dressy look and my favourite, add a matching patiala/churidar and contrast dupatta for an Indian look.

Classy power suit</h2>I am so glad that 90s are having a come back but what Iâ€™m even more glad for is the comeback of power suits. No woman has felt more powerful and strong as they have in power suits. Structured clothing can never fit wrong on anybody and power suits are an example of that. Wearing a formal skirt or a formal dress might not be in everyoneâ€™s comfort zone and I feel power suits are an amazing alternative for that. <br><br> <h2>4. White t-shirt</h2>A white t-shirt goes a long way. It goes with literally everything. Get a proper medium size white t-shirt, not too baggy, not too tight. Pair it up with a skirt, pants, shorts, underneath a dungaree etc. and you are good to go. White t-shirt is a staple that every woman should have in their wardrobe as you can never go wrong with it. ', '<h2>5. Silk blouse</h2>Silk might not seem like an affordable option so you could always switch it with satin. But only clothing item that I know that can be worn for formal and informal events is a silk blouse. Pair it up with a pair of trousers for a formal look and tie it like a normal shirt with a flared skirt for a chic look. Dusty rose , powder blue, camel or the evergreen white are my favourite colours for a silk blouse. <br><br> <h2>6. Black strappy heels</h2>Back when the only form of heels was either stilettos or wedges, it was really difficult for me to select. But block heels has been my and I guess every other girlâ€™s saviour ever since they came out. A pair of strappy block heels is something that I donâ€™t think is going out of fashion anytime soon. It came back 2 years ago and is still the most used type of heels till date. It goes with all office, casual and party outfits and every woman must have them in their wardrobe! ', '<h2>7. Statement necklace</h2>Wearing statement earrings can get a little uncomfortable as they are quite huge and our ears end up paining all night. Thatâ€™s why I feel statement necklaces completely changes the game for us women. It can turn a dull outfit into a classy one.Some accentuating chokers can make your collar bones look so good. Colaba in Mumbai is one of my favourite places to find such extraordinary pieces. ', '', 'swetapanchamiablog1image4.jpeg'),

Tailored suit</h2>A good fitted tailored suit is something every man should have. Right from work to weddings to a formal date, a classic tailored suit can be worn in a number of ways. In my opinion, a grey or a black suit is more flexible than any other colour as it goes with more colours. You could pair your blazer with denim pants for a more casual look , with linen shorts for a cocktail party look, your pants with a formal shirt etc. the list is endless. A tailored suit might be expensive but it sure is an investment every man should do.\r\n<h2>2. Dark denim pants</h2>As I said, denim is classic and timeless. But a dark pair of denim pants is what suits a man the best. Skinny jeans might be trendy for now but a straight cut dark denim is what will get you through years. Dress it with your sports coat, a polo or your favourite graphic t-shirt, it just wonâ€™t disappoint you. If youâ€™re not so experimental with trying different looks then denim is definitely something you should opt for.', 'Fashion;Style;Him;For Men', 'swetapanchamiablog2image1.jpg', 'swetapanchamiablog2image2.jpeg', 'swetapanchamiablog2image3.jpeg', 'swetapanchamiablog2image4.jpeg', '2020-06-03', 1, '<h2>3. White button down shirt</h2>A good fabric white shirt is every manâ€™s staple. You pair it up with your denim, shorts, trousers, chinos etc. it just goes with everything. A blue toned white shirt is preferred than a yellow toned or else you can end up looking like an eggshell. It holds the power of making a man look extremely professional or casual depending on how you style it and thatâ€™s the beauty of it.\r\n<h2>4. Light coloured chinos</h2>For people who love to experiment with colours and different styles, chinos is something that they definitely should try. Chinos are ideal for more casual affairs but they are changing the game in formal wear too. Offices nowadays are more open to flexible styling and chinos are a game changer for men there. They are so comfortable and yet stylish. Pair it up with a striped t-shirt for a classic look or go old school and throw on a white shirt and youâ€™ll be good to go. All pastel shades are my go to choice for chinos.', '<h2>5. Cashmere sweater</h2>Hereâ€™s a thing about cashmere sweater, not only is it super soft, classic, and warm for the colder months, itâ€™s the ideal piece, whether headed home for the holidays, meeting your girlfriendâ€™s parents for the first time, or even for casual Fridays around the office. Something this versatile definitely deserves a spot in your closet. A solid sweater will last in style more than a checkered or a white one. Go for dark colors like maroon, navy blue, grey, brown etc.\r\n<h2>6. A pair of oxfords</h2>A pair of professional oxfords can never steer you wrong, particularly for formal wear. Choose something in black or brown leather â€“ they can look just as great with suits as they can with khakis and a sport coat. Loafers are definitely a wise addition to your closet, but theyâ€™re also considered less formal than oxfords. If you work in an office with a business professional dress code, itâ€™s best to opt for oxfords. If you have a little more leeway, then polished, neutral loafers are usually fine.', '<h2>7. Good looking watch</h2>Regardless of your job, every man should own at least one grown-up watch: One that has a clean face, leather or metal band, and looks great with more formal clothing. Whether you go for gold, silver, or leather, a well-made watch shows off your personal style, so choose wisely. Of course you can keep your fun plastic watches, but reserve them for casual events and weekends, rather than work. ', '', 'swetapanchamiablog2image5.jpeg'),
(8, 'Top Underrated Shows you might have probably missed out on', 'This Quarantine has left us looking for sources of entertainment at every nook and corner. And obviously, it is going to take some more time before we step out of our houses. That is when these online streaming platforms come into picture. For a country obsessed over motion pictures as the most profound source of media and entertainment, TV Shows and movies seem to be everyones obvious choices for entertainment as well. Netflix & Prime Video havent just become a household name but also one of the common means of a modern day man. \r\n<br>\r\nFollowing is a list of some of the shows, in no particular order which you might have probably missed out on. These are some of the most critically acclaimed shows of our time which went under-shadowed due to some or the other reason. If you are a TV fanatic, trust me, you will be delighted to see the shows enlisted here:\r\n<br>\r\nThe images used below are purely used for visual representation. All rights reserved by their respective owners. Do reach out to us first, in case of any concerns or issues.\r\n<h2>1. Utopia</h2>\r\nThere are shows which make an impact on you in such a way that they leave you sleepless for nights together. Well, Utopia is one such show. A Visual Manuscript for a cult novel goes missing and so two groups of people set out to find it. One of them is a Government Organisation who believes it has a secret which could help save the human race and civilisation on this planet, and the others are a bunch of readers who met online and want it to not go in the wrong hands. How and what happens ahead is beautifully depicted in the most visually enriching experience I have ever had. The show is filled with colourful landscapes and frames, so vivid if seen on a colour palette, that you do feel you are reading a visual novel. The show has two seasons only because it was called off due to it having intense violence and gory scenes that it was broadcasted at 11PM at night in UK, the country of its origin. The show is surprisingly weird and uncomfortable. To get your head around it, maybe try watching its trailer on YouTube ;)', 'TV Series; Web Series; Binge Watch', 'rishabhjainblog1image1.jpeg', 'rishabhjainblog1image2.jpeg', 'rishabhjainblog1image3.jpeg', 'rishabhjainblog1image4.jpeg', '2020-06-03', 2, '<h2>2. LOST</h2>\r\nIf Breaking Bad was never to be made or if we lived in a world without the existence of Breaking Bad, LOST would have been the Greatest TV Series of all time. And this is not a judgement made by me, but what the critics and readers have to say about the show, throughout the globe. Oceanic Flight 815 crashes on an island with some passengers surviving. But here is the catch, the island seems to have no existence on the world map. Will they be rescued? You need to have intense patience to know this because this is one of the biggest series ever created with 6 seasons and nearly 120 episodes, each episode having a run-time of 50 minutes approx. The show was credited to have the most expensive pilot episode costing over $14 Million (in 2005). If you are in for a big commitment, go check out its trailer or rather the first episode itself right now!\r\n<h2>3. Video Game High School (VGHS)</h2>\r\n\r\nImagine if there was a Hogwards like school, but for videogames. I have the attention of atleast the boys reading this already. Video Game High School as the name suggests is a High School dedicated for imparting knowledge to students in the fields of Video Games. The show is a light hearted comedy with satirical drama created to mock mainstream drama films and shows. The show revolves around a young boy who wins an online gaming tournament and receives a chance to study at the glorious Institute. It is freely available on YouTube with all of its 20-25 minutes episodes streaming in 720p. A visual delight for sure.', '<h2>4. The Act</h2>\r\n\r\nAny Crime-Drama fans in the house? Here is a treat for you all particularly. The Act is an American show based on a true case which goes by the name of Dee Dee Blanchard Murder Case , based on a mother creating an aura of fake illness of her daughter for the sake of getting satisfaction of taking care of her. This illness, Factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA), is a condition where a caregiver creates the appearance of health problems in another person, typically their child. This may include injuring the child or altering test samples. They then present the person as being sick or injured. This occurs without a specific benefit to the caregiver apart from gaining attention of the world which gives a sense of satisfaction to the care-giver. Sounds twisted enough already? Well, all Ill say is go watch it for yourself.\r\n<h2>5. Wild Wild Country</h2>\r\n\r\nYou might have heard about this show boom when it came out back in 2018. But did you watch it? Well, if not here is why should you watch it ASAP. Based on an Indian Guru Bhagwaan Rajneesh, fondly known by the name of Osho, Wild Wild Country is a docu-drama series created on the life of this controversial individual who was banished from India, but went on to create his own dystopian city Rajneeshpuram in the United States. He esatblishes his cult over there and gains a lot of followers who worship him. But guess what, he is not the protagonist of this show. The centre of attraction is his then Secretary Maa Anand Sheela, who was regarded as most controversial female in United States, at that time. Throughout the show you will only see yourself in a complete awe as to how these two went on to run the biggest non religious cult in the whole world and how they were later accused to plan a bio-terrorist attack, rig an election and even plot a murder of a US Federal Agent. \r\n', '<h2>6. Mr Robot </h2>\r\n\r\nAnother show you might have heard about. Mr Robot, a psychological and techno thriller is based around a young individual who is a cybersecurity engineer by day and an activist hacker by night named Elliot Alderson. Alderson is then hired by an anarchist, who goes by alias of Mr Robot, to work with a group of hackers like him. The show was highly rated and was critically acclaimed for its unconventional screenplay, thought provoking plot and a dark theme. The show has four seasons and each episode is titled in a very unique way. The director of this show Sam Esmail, happens to give a very satisfying ending to this show which is well deserved. Before you proceed to watch, let me warn you a couple of things. First being, that even you might hear voices in your brains just like the lead protagonist and Secondly,while you reach the end if the second season, you make feel like your mind is playing games on you. Because Control is an illusion. With the advent of the famous hacker group Anonymous being very active today, you definitely dont want to miss out on a show which is based on them!', 'This is our list of 6 shows you should definitely give a watch if you havent. So maybe stop rewatching FRIENDS or The Big Bang Theory or The Office.<br> \r\nNo, not The Office. That show is a human treasure.\r\n', 'rishabhjainblog1image5.jpeg'),

Lunges</h2>Challenging your balance is an essential part of a well-rounded exercise routine.  Lunges do just that, promoting functional movement, while also increasing strength in your legs and glutes.\r\n<br><h3>STEPS</h3>\r\n1.Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms down at your sides.\r\n<br>2.Take a step forward with your right leg and bend your right knee as you do so, stopping when your thigh is parallel to the ground.  Ensure that your right knee doesnâ€™t extend past your right foot.\r\n<br>3.Push up off your right foot and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. This is one rep. Complete 10 reps for 3 sets. \r\n\r\n<h2>2. Pushups</h2>Drop and give me 20! Pushups are one of the most basic yet  effective bodyweight moves you can perform because of the number of muscles that are recruited to perform them\r\n<br><h3>STEPS</h3>\r\n1.Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral.\r\n<br>2.Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor.  When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows and return to the start.  Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement.\r\n<br>3.Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible.  If you canâ€™t quite perform a standard pushup with good form,  drop down to a modified stance on your knees â€” youâ€™ll still reap many of the benefits from this exercise while building strength.

Squats</h2>Squats increase lower body and core strength, as well as flexibility in your lower back and hips.  Because they engage some of the largest muscles in the body, they also pack a major punch in terms of calories burned.\r\n<br><h3>STEPS</h3>\r\n1.Startby standing straight, with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your arms at your sides.\r\n<br>2.Brace your core and, keeping your chest and chin up, push your hips back and bend your knees as if youâ€™re going to sit in a chair.\r\n<br>3.Ensuring your knees donâ€™t bow inward or outward, drop down until your thighs are parallel to the ground,  bringing your arms out in front of you in a comfortable position. Pause for one second, then extend your legs and return to the starting position.  Complete 3 sets of 20 reps.', '<h2>4. SITUPS</h2>Although they get a bad rap as being too basic, situps are an effective way to target your abdominal muscles.  If you have lower back problems, stick with a crunch, which requires just your upper back and shoulders to lift off the ground.\r\n<br><h3>STEPS</h3>\r\n1.Start by lying on the ground on your back with your knees bent, feet flat, and your hands behind your head.\r\n<br>2.Keeping your feet glued to the ground, begin to roll up from your head, engaging your core throughout.  Donâ€™t strain your neck during the upward motion.\r\n<br>3.When your chest reaches your legs, begin the controlled phase back down to the starting position.  Complete 3 sets of 15 reps as a beginner.', '<h2>5. Side Planks</h2>A healthy body requires a strong core at its foundation, so donâ€™t neglect core- specific moves like the side plank.  Focus on the mind-muscle connection and controlled movements to ensure youâ€™re completing this move effectively.\r\n<br><h3>STEPS</h3>\r\n1. Lie on your right side with your left leg and foot stacked on top of your right leg and foot.  Prop your upper body up by placing your right forearm on the ground, elbow directly under your shoulder.  <br>2.Contract your core to stiffen your spine and lift your hips and knees off the ground, forming a straight line with your body.  <br>3.Return to start in a controlled manner.

However, it also comes with the risk for losses depending upon the instrument and securities in which you make investment. We are going to discuss here explore the best investment instruments to invest in the ascending order of their returns with very low or no risk', 'Finance; Investment', 'sandeepyadavblog1headerimage.jpg', 'sandeepyadavblog1image1.jpeg', 'sandeepyadavblog1image2.jpeg', 'sandeepyadavblog1image3.jpeg', '2020-06-04', 4, '<h2>1. Traditional instruments</h2> When we talk about traditional instruments the first things which comes in our mind is Fixed deposit (FD) but you know there are ample of other investment like KVPY, RD, LIC who also claim to give the same returns of 6-8 percent. Even the G-sec bonds (securities issued by government of India to raise money by giving some amount of return per year), treasury bills kind of investment which is also a risk free investment gives the same 6-8 percent returns over the long time frame. Since these are the traditional instruments so many of you claim at least these are risk free investment which give ample amount of return but when you perfectly calculate tax deduction and exemptions you better get to know that these instruments after adjusting to present inflation rate give 1-2 percent returns . So, next time when you think of investing in FDs donâ€™t rush to do before thinking carefully since in these new investing era of 20th century we have other instruments which give far good adequate return as compared to Traditional investment', '<h2>2. Sovereign gold bond</h2> Importing Gold affects the economy by raising our fiscal deficts. But, people are obsessed with gold in India. However, there exists a way through which people can invest in gold, reap benefits and also, India doesnâ€™t have to import for that. Weâ€™re referring to Sovereign Gold Bonds. Investing in these bonds is the smarter way of gold investment. However, if youâ€™re obsessed with gold jewelry, this doesnâ€™t apply to that. Sovereign gold bonds are issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on behalf of the government, this is not a risky investment to be afraid to invest. Gold bonds offer an annual interest rate of 2.50% to investors additionally from capital appreciation (increase in price value). When you purchase a gold bond, you just have to comply with the lock-in period (which is of mainly five years) and your deposit gets its value based on the gold price post the lock-in period is over. So, if the prices soared, youâ€™ll receive returns accordingly and by chance, if the price went down, the value of your deposit will be adjusted accordingly. These bonds have given the returns of 12% over the period of time', '<h2>3.Mutual funds</h2> Have you ever thought about investing in mutual funds? They have been there for more than 30 years. However, increasing incomes over the years, reduced bank deposit rates, demand of market, and awareness among investors have led to immense popularity of mutual funds as an investment instrument. People prefer to invest in mutual funds mainly because of the higher returns as compared to other government schemes and security. many of you know it by simply coming through the ad campaign \" Mutual fund sahi hai\".so let me tell you how it works ,these mutual fund investment institutions(AMCs) collect money from common people like you and me. The money thus acquired is then invested in various streams that would get you returns. At the end of the period for which you invested, the mutual fund management company will return the amount you\'ve invested along with the gains earned. This is otherwise known as the maturity amount. It is effectively managed by an expert who has good knowledge about the market. However, they will deduct roughly about 1-3 % from the returns as a fee. Mostly their returns range from 11% to 25% as according to the schemes you invest in it', '<h2>4.Passive Investing(Index Investing)</h2> You know that over the decades Indian stock market(Sensex) has given the returns of 17 percent which is compounded annually. Inshort it means your investment get doubled after every 4.3 years over the decades. In the same period, gold gave a rupee return of 10%. So letâ€™s see what is actually passive investing and how can we take good profits by doing these Passive investing uses market-weighted indexes and portfolios to invest funds and avoid many of the fees common to more active investment strategies. basically it is the investment in the stock market on some selected group of stocks by National stock exchange (NSE) or Bombay stock exchange (BSE) ex.

(11, 'HOW TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF (this is different)', 'Before reading this article, why do you need to know â€œhow to introduce yourself?â€ Are you here to make an introduction of yourself interesting? Or are you here to use those titles that you might not even mean?\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much this article is not about giving you contents to your introduction. Its just a review of how you can frame who you are and what you do in better way. So, who you are and what you do is a personal subject to explore, (for Godâ€™s Sake, do not search for who you are in articles!)\r\n<br>\r\nBut what is an introduction? Is that a repetitive speech? Does that imply the same everywhere? Do you introduce yourself with same exact words when you are up for an interview and when you are at relativeâ€™s place? Or worse, you have worked so much on your resume for your career, that you have no idea how to introduce yourself at a party? Or were you going to impress someone with your technical skills? Lets take a look at some of the points:\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>1. Be interesting</h2>This is one of the factors you really need to work on. Why would someone be interested in listening to your boring speech. Even if you have your own opinions, maybe they are brilliant but if no one listens whatâ€™s the point in saying. So, make your introduction interesting. Use simple words. If the conversation is informal, you may add your personal touch as to why you do something, what drives you to do something. People around you, always love that personal connection. If the conversation is formal, you may make it very simple as to what you do and how it helps yourself and others.', 'Self-Confidence; Introduce', 'maitrimarublog1headerimage.jpeg', 'maitrimarublog1image1.jpeg', 'maitrimarublog1image2.jpeg', 'maitrimarublog1image3.jpeg', '2020-06-04', 3, '<h2>2. Short & exciting.</h2> Again, people might read a 250-page long book but might not understand even a paragraph. So, whatever is the content it must be exciting. Make them think â€œWhatâ€™s more?!â€ But again, lets say for example, you could be good at writing, thereâ€™s no need to specify that you write poetry, blogs, newsletter. Keep it simple and use single word. If other person finds it interesting, you would be there with a next follow up question. Or you know coding languages, no need to specify all the languages you know. If the person is aware of those languages, you might get a follow up question and if the person is not aware of any languages, your extra words are just making the conversation boring and forceful.', '<h2>3. Be relatable</h2>  Context really matters. Its not something, that one asks you to introduce yourself and you start that speech which you have prepared so hard. Who would want to know what you excel at, at a party! Or how using those great words, skills in front of your relatives (maybe to impress them) who donâ€™t even understand a single word. Speak the same language! And definitely here a translator wont help. Speak according to your environment. â€œCatch attention in few secondsâ€', '<h2>4. Follow-up question</h2>  This always works when thereâ€™s a two-way communication, not interviewer-interviewee relationship. So, this works when you are having an informal chat. Always have some follow- up question at the end of your statement. This might be asking the other person about their hobbies, how their work is helping them and the society. Avoid any sensitive topics or one where you might have differences. If you disagree with someone, you may make your point, but donâ€™t be too harsh or try to change that personâ€™s thinking. If making your point doesnâ€™t go well, just change the topic. And if you really want to make a difference, just write a blog! Avoid discussions on politics, religion. Focus more on open-ended questions.', '<h2>5. Donâ€™t say too much</h2> \r\nBe short and concise. Be it in your emails or face to face conversations. Have a one sentence pitch ready, which might work at almost every place â€œwho you are and what you doâ€œ. Know the difference when to use your title and companyâ€™s name. If it doesnâ€™t matter or is not necessary, avoid it. You might just end up flaunting.\r\n<br> \r\nSo, this can be the flow.\r\n<br>\r\ni. A short sentence with â€œwho you are and what you doâ€œ.\r\n<br>\r\nii. A follow-up question to the other person. \r\n<br>\r\niii. Engaging in an authentic conversation, by asking what other personâ€™s goals are, or what \r\nthey look forward to\r\n<br>\r\niv. Talking about what drives you crazy. Sharing your story. \r\n<br>Well, introductions can be classified: \r\n<br>a. Emails\r\n<br>b. Social media\r\n<br>c. Informal (face to face)\r\n<br>d. Interview\r\n<br>e. Presentations\r\n<br>f. Party \r\n<br>Avoid mentioning your age. How you carry a conversation matters, not the age \r\n<br>You may talk about hobbies when you are at a party. â€œHi, I am Maitri. I am Adityaâ€™s music class friend. (the birthday boy!!!). How do you know Aditya?â€œ\r\n<br>When in a formal conversation, â€œHi, I am Maitri. I do this for a living, what do you doâ€œ or â€œHi, I am Maitri. I am about to graduate/working for X company for Y years, what do you doâ€œ \r\n<br>When you are likely to attend any professional event or an event where people come from different backgrounds, you can have a basic conversation of who you are, where you are from (a place can be a start point to a great conversation) â€œHi, I am Maitri. I am from ABC/ I am originally from ABC but I have been living in PQR since X yearsâ€œ and then let the conversation start. \r\n<br>If you want to build a relationship, ask a follow-up question. \r\n<br>Be concise while writing an email. Forget those school methods. We, young people really need to know, how to write emails. There are so many emails a firm receives, its unlikely to read all the emails. So, hoping that they read your best lines, focus on how they will just open your email. Talk about their interest, not yours. First give, then take. \r\n<br>Assuming that two people follow each other on social media, you can strike a conversation with â€œHey! I have been following you for a couple of days/weeks. I want to ask you a question. Do you ____?â€œ or its been a long time you havenâ€™t talked to your friend. â€œHey! Its been a long time we met/chatted. How have you been?â€œ \r\n<br>Talking about presentations, which is more likely a one-way communication, donâ€™t just start with a presentation. Introduce yourself, always. Maybe you can use less words and just add a slide about who you are and what you do (again less words to speak doesnâ€™t mean more words to read in a slide!) Greeting with a picture of yours. Or a special quote from your native place (just to add a little bit of humor, this should not be used everywhere) or presenting your skillsets in diagrammatic way in a slide. \r\n<br>Interview: Itâ€™s likely that your resume has been already read once. So, donâ€™t be repetitive. When given chance to speak something outside the resume about yourself. Give a little hint about your personality and what interests you and what does not. Because, the way you speak makes a difference in impact than simply writing it on the Resume. \r\n<br>I would conclude, â€œBuild your resume, but resume is not the only identity you have. Resume is just a part of your identityâ€œ Ask yourself, how will you make friends in a school, with your bench partner (did you even know what resume was then) How will you introduce yourself, when you retire? How will you introduce yourself, when you are on a vacation? \r\n<br>This article is not a spoon feed, itâ€™s more than that! Its more about knowing yourself. Its about exploring yourself. It is finding an answer to <h3>â€œwho you are?â€œ</h3> and <h3>â€œwho you really want to be known as?â€œ.</h3> ', 'maitrimarublog1image4.jpg');

The goal of this project is to automate cab booking so that customers do not need to walk-in or call in order to book a cab. They can go online and book any kind of cab they want from the inventory of available vehicles.

User  Interface:  HTML,  CSS,  JS,  and Bootstrap For our User Interface,  and Flask for Python as the backend and by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) means the subtitles that are extracted from YouTube are given to a default CNN model in our flask backend server. CNN model and Hugging Face transformer is used to classify suitable relevant text according to video content and subtitles tto create summary from the entire content. The project will provide  user to summarize the long youtube videos which have captions and which will be around 1 hour or more. and user can also download the summarized forms, such as pdf and word, and share  his summarized transcript by email and WhatsApp. user will be provided with many other features like Translate : Users can translate their summarized text into different languages provided. , Speak : If a user is unable to read the transcript can use this option, clicking on speak buttonwill speak aloud the summarized transcript of any language., Download : Users can download their summarized text into different file formats. The\r\noutputfor downloading the summarized text into different file formats, Send to mail : If a user wants to share the transcript file to his/her mail or wants to share it with their friends can use this.\r\n\r\n\r\nso basically front-end technologies we are using  is:\r\n\r\n* HTML\r\n* CSS\r\n*JAVASCRIPT\r\n*BOOTSTRAP\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Back-end technologies are:\r\n\r\n\r\n*Python Api\r\n*Flask\r\n*Hugging face tranformer\r\n*Text to speech\r\n*Google translation system\r\n\r\nAnd algorithms are:\r\n\r\n*DEEP Learning algorithms CNN\r\n*CNN\r\n*NLP\r\n\r\nAlso we want to add a feature in which the user itself will decide in how many sentences or words he or she wants to get the summary.it would be great. please see If this feature will also be possible.

Do what makes you happy as a carrer.\r\nPeople tell me, it\'s not easy to make your passion your job. \r\nI wonder. Every morning ,Monday to Friday 9-5 work and sitting there punching away the hours stressing about the work at hand \r\nIs that what makes you happy?

Be a musician, a dancer, an animator, YouTuber, VJ, anything and anyone that makes you proud to be.\r\n\r\n Decide between luxury and passion. Think what do you want out of life?\r\n What do you see when you close your eyes and imagine yourself in 5 years, the way your heart wants things to be like? \r\n\r\nIf you see a career that flows so perfectly with your passion that the border between \'work\' and \'fun\' doesn\'t even exist. Then my friend, chase your dreams.\r\n Find a passion that matches your talent and run with it. \r\n\r\n\" Chase your PASSIONS and money will come. Chase MONEY and you may never find your passion \". \r\n\r\nWhat about money? That\'s not running anywhere. Your efforts will pay you off any which ways. Money is a Medium of happiness. It\'s not the long lasting one. Your needs might be satisfied but then what about your heart? What does it wants? \r\n \r\nWell, Even a scientist can be a writer, even a dancer can be a doctor. Just do what you love and love what you do. Believe in yourself for once. Trust your talents and passion. You may fall, but rise up higher than before. \r\n\r\n\" Money is the purpose.

But when I hear Androids and Gynoids, I hear technology, not as an end user but as an innovator and/or someone willing to learn and then take things to a different level. \r\nWhen I hear Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Virtual Reality (VR), the passion reaches another level. AI, for instance, has fascinated me since it arrived as a fact of life.\r\n--------------\r\nWhen it comes to technology,\r\nbeauty lies in the detail!\r\n\r\nTechnological advancements have made it possible and even encouraged people to connect with fellow humans in all parts of the world. They have also helped in resolving some of our greatest challenges faced by mankind.\r\n\r\nSome of the challenges are faced within the four walls of an organization on a regular basis. Adding the different dimensions to human communication has been a work in progress, and it seems to be entering a new era.\r\n\r\nThe Oblongâ€™s Mezzanine is a case in point. An interactive visual collaboration, which supports multi-users, multi-devices, multi-screens at multiple locations, OM could benefit users in many ways.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it seeks to reprogram and enhance the way colleagues work, both within the meeting rooms as well as chipping in from different parts of the world. OM ensures convenience is the name of the game for more teams in more workstations.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s unique features, such as its multi-image option, can be very useful across multiple platforms. Highlighting just one dimension of its various features indicates the possibilities that exist within its realm.\r\n\r\nPicture this - collaborative meetings can become even more smooth as it could refer to any PowerPoint, any database, and encompass various applications, all at the same time.\r\n\r\nIts multi-screening feature has the capacity to make the workplace more captivating, and the work environment more interactive and innovative. It opens a plethora of possibilities that few had imagined years ago.\r\n\r\nThe coming together of multiple people from different sources not only builds interactivity, it also makes content look more attractive.\r\n\r\nThe beauty lies in the detail though. Multi-streaming supports up to 10 streaming devices per room at once. This makes the discussions easy and brings topics and designs together as multiple streams of presentations can be shared at the same time using this device.\r\n\r\nMezzanine also ensures efficient ways of sharing, collaborating and contributing during seminars and meetings. All this has a tremendous effect on improving the productivity of the team.\r\n\r\nSo Mezzanine provides the user with dynamic features making the workplace more productive and innovative. The end result is a visually-immersive meeting and an interactive environment for the employees.\r\n\r\nLooked holistically, the features contained in Mezzanine go a long way in accommodating the different ideas and enhancing their presentation. Itâ€™s this attention to detail that brings focus on the big picture within any organization. \r\n\r\nHow to be more creative with your presentation?\r\n\r\nMezzanine provides with creative teamwork, meetings, and sales presentations. It also combines application sharing, designing and video \r\nconferencing, all within a framework of multi-participant control.\r\n\r\n     Users and team members can share content and information from laptops or mobile devices.\r\n\r\n-     EFFICIENCY in work?\r\n\r\nMezzanine enhances decision making, as it gives the customer or the user clear idea of all possible product and design specifications. Every participant of the team can share their ideas, live content and active participation in decision making. Elevates Customer Experience with large-screen environments.\r\n\r\n      Higher- impact on services, as it helps multiple team members share and compare data to make informed decisions. It is one stop for making meetings, presentation and communications, working sessions more advance and intelligent. Mezzanine go a long way in accommodating the different ideas and enhancing their presentation. Itâ€™s this attention to detail that brings focus on the big picture within any organization. \r\n\r\n- Neda Sayed\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\nPython 3 may be a new choice but Python 2 remains a legacy!\r\n\r\nPython is generally viewed as an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Most programmers deal with Python as sophisticated and as more productive than other programming languages. \r\n\r\nPython-2 was officially released on February 20, 1991, developed by Guido Van Rossum. It became one of the most broadly implemented programming languages in the world and  made code development process easier than its earlier avatars. It executeded specialized  technical details of Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP).\r\n\r\nPython 2 vs Python 3\r\n\r\nSunset of Python-2 means the developers will no longer improve it even if someone finds a security problem in it. They must upgrade to Python-3 at the earliest. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of switching to Python-3 was to help to compose a framework that sets variables or characteristics to the â€œtypeâ€ property. This is significant considering Python-2 is an untyped language, which obstructs making of new codes. Python-3 improves the simplicity of composing and getting code, just as the exhibition of the code\'s runtime. Python-3 has clear, existing commands previously built into the code, making it very easy to use. For instance, in Syntax print â€œlineâ€ in Python-2 becomes print (â€œlineâ€) in Python 3, it changes print from a statement to a function. \r\nSignificant service of Python- 3 was released in 2008 to beat the blemishes and issues in Python-2.\r\n\r\nClosure\r\n\r\nPython-2 has already been  phased out, as Python-3\'s  adoption is the clear direction of the future: its the new choice! \r\nPython-3 supports more features, good compatibility and is dominant over Python-2. So it is better to prefer Python-3 for your programming profession and software development.\r\n'),

(11, 'Shaariq', 'D', 9004427540, 'shaariqdude@gmail.com', '----', 'Economics', 'English', 'English', '', 'Book review of â€œThe Confessions of and Economic Hitmanâ€ â€“ John Perkins\r\n\r\nJohn Perkins was once upon a time a self-anointed â€œeconomic hit manâ€ (EHM) whose primary role was to infiltrate developing nations with large sums of money to bribe and loan out to big leaders, which would then be extracted for concessions to USA business interests. His book made it to the â€œNew York Times Best Seller Listâ€ and has been termed as an eye-opening expose of USAâ€™s role in the developing world.\r\n\r\nThe book â€œThe Confessions of an Economic Hitmanâ€ begins with Perkinâ€™s account of recruitment by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and his initial placement in Ecuador to learn more about his job. His first hit entailed working for a private international consulting firm (MAIN) and fudging numbers in order to show great economic growth in the next 20-25 years through the building of a hydroelectric dam, and similar infrastructure projects. These numbers were going to be sent to the World Bank who would then decide if they should give out a loan to Ecuador for the same. He was trained to project such numbers so that the loan money given would be funneled to US corporations such as Bechtel, Halliburton, Stone & Webster, among others that would in-turn help USA. This was his training project under his handler, who ensured he was ready to be sent out on his own.\r\n\r\nHis first individual project consisted of forecasting 25 year electricity demand for Indonesia. His job was to overestimate these numbers in such a way that it served their â€œmaster planâ€ of getting the oil industry among others, what they wanted. He overestimated the numbers successfully, the Indonesian government, Asian Development Bank, and other organisations, all lent out money that went on to help US corporations.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapters of the book, Perkins gives us a different point of view to major events that helped establish US hegemony through the acts of EHMâ€™s like him. The job usually entailed bribes and giving IMF advice or a nudge on matters that would end up benefitting the USA, but if they werenâ€™t enough, then â€œjackalsâ€ were called to complete the â€œhitsâ€. Some matters of public record such as CIAâ€™s coup against Mossadegh in Iran, assassination of Panamaâ€™s president Omar Torrijos, Saudi money-laundering affair, among other major events, were all the acts of the â€œjackalsâ€ among the hitmen, when peaceful ways didnâ€™t work.\r\n\r\nThe author thought about the dealings and intensity of the EHMs as like the Mafia, in which their employment titles and beguiling resumes are as scrappy as the authenticity of the financial arrangements made with the other nation. For example, Columbia was taken a gander at by the United States as a vital region to advance political and business interests. Huge investments in electrical power grids, highways, and telecommunications would open up Columbia\'s gas and oil assets. The authors job was, indeed, to go to Columbia, present an argument for accepting an exceedingly huge loan for inflated electric and economic forecasts under the appearance of development. Similar to the mob, EHMs are offered a lot of money for a straightforward jobâ€” for instance, making a phony financial arrangement expressing that for the following 25 years, a nation would see a 17â€“20% expansion in economic growth. What nation can deny the estimates of a specialised economist and conceivably miss such an amazing arrangement?\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the author put forth a bold attempt to become companions with numerous local people in the nations he goes to, including bearing a puppet show in Indonesia that ridiculed the U.S. president and the work he himself was doing in the nation, he was ridden with blame. He portrayed himself in the book as an individual genuinely attempting to comprehend the nations\' point of view of conditions, political changes that occurred en route, and their definitive dread of death brought about by their monetary and political choices. Throughout the book his progressive deceit is described as standard working procedure in the most elevated echelons and his internal moral conflict due to his activities, the reader is left to think it is simply a question of time before Perkins himself will be simply the objective of a â€œjackalâ€ for distributing this data in book form. In spite of the fact that the author kept on filling in as an EHM for well more than 10 years, he did at last come to the realisation to follow his merciful heart to support the nations and companions he had made en route. His passion for those he once wronged for money and the globetrotting way of life. He zeroed in on applying his efforts in endeavours for everyone\'s benefit, for a superior world, which didn\'t include MAIN, the U.S. government, or some other EHM counselling firm, but instead included talking at global gatherings to teach future pioneers about the environmental and social costs influencing their nations and how to unravel them through green endeavours and recovering agribusiness.\r\nWith vivid representation of debt traps for developing countries, and the environmental impact of exploitation of Oil in Ecuador and Indonesia, it appeals to the eyes of development and international economics students. He also highlights the misleading picture of GNP as a measure of economic progress, and criticises the â€œtrickle-down economicsâ€ theory. He puts it as, helping economies grow to only allow the few people at the top of the pyramid become richer while those at the bottom continue to suffer, only pushes them lower. Capitalism here results in an inequal society like that of the medieval era.\r\n\r\nBeing a student of Economics, I couldnâ€™t put the book down, and the spy-thriller style really appealed to me. It made me more aware about the involvement of US in the global economy. Perkins also uses the terms â€œempireâ€ and â€œcorporatocracyâ€ to define Americaâ€™s approach, but in his epilogue he does provide guidance to move from this structure. He says, in order to stop this corporatocracy, we should reduce our oil consumption, and shopping expedition, and join in the seldom protests. This statement, wins the hearts of those who support capitalism as well, the ones who focus on the benefits, but acknowledge the costs too. He is not against capitalism per say, he is against the idea of exploiting the poor and weak to give back only to the ones at the top of the pyramid.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the book was the right mixture of first-hand experience and geopolitical conspiracy, that was quite appealing, easy to read and a good introduction to the world financial order.\r\n'),

Your report should demonstrate wide reading and comprehension of the theoretical frameworks introduced in the module. You are expected to draw on key concepts and frameworks to analyse the process of launching new ventures. Good reports will draw on theoretical concepts to show understanding of the challenges typically encountered when creating a new venture. This may include frameworks explaining the influence of uncertainty and related knowledge problems on new ventures; strategies for creating new firms, the foundersâ€™ role, and how entrepreneurs can overcome challenges such as resource dependency and liabilities of newness/scale.\r\n\r\nPart 2: A Self-reflection (30%)  Written in the first person (I) this part of the report should demonstrate your personal understanding of the process of creating a new venture. You do not need to draw on theoretical frameworks in Part 2. Instead, you can draw on previous entrepreneurial experiences (e.g., founding your own firm, working for start-ups, entrepreneurial competitions (e.g., Ingenuity) internships, family business etc). It may also be helpful to draw on your experiences during this module. For example, what insights did you gain from designing a Business Model for a new venture? What might you do differently? Finally, you may project into the future to consider how you would approach the process of launching a new venture. Have you gained any insights from this module that you would use in the future if you were creating your own venture or joining a start-up?\r\n\r\nSome key points to consider:\r\n\r\n1)   The individual report requires two parts: Part 1 is a standard academic essay with references, introduction, discussion, and conclusion.

The hyper-spectral image includes various image bands. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an extensively useful deep learning algorithm for data visualization and processing. Both the Spatial along with Spectral information are important for HSI classes to be effective. Due to the higher computing complexity, only a few approaches have used 3D CNN. Hybrid Spectral Convolutional 2D-3D Network (HybridSN) is instituted for HSI classing in this paper. HybridSN involves a spatial and spectral 3D-CNN which is then trailed by a spatial 2D. A study of more abstract level spatial representation will continue with 2D-CNN over 3D-CNN. Furthermore, when compared to conventional CNNs, the employment of hybrid CNNs lessens the modelâ€™s complexity. To see if this hybrid method works, a thorough HSI phase test was performed over Indian Pines, Salinas and Pavia University and results compared to ground truth. The presented HybridSN HSI classification model provides with best result.\r\nMapping the quilt of land and land use (LULC) using the long distance sensory records has been a task for a long time because of diverse capabilities and mixtures, especially in all exclusive city areas.LULC facts are extensively used in Geographic facts device (GIS) applications. Accordingly, correct, high-quality maps and precise statistics are wanted anywhere and whenever. Despite the fact that images and remote sensing techniques,in addition with subject exploration, have been key resources for figuring out the land use characteristics, the inner dimensions of neighbourhood statistics based totally information series for oneâ€™s capabilities have constantly been a hard step in terms of time, money, and so forth because of the reliability of the data.\r\nImage classification is a rapid method and the most commonly used one in areas of computer vision incorporated with Hyper-spectral Image Classification (HSI) for remote sensing image survey. The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are one of the most broadly utilized deep learning-based computing algorithms. HSI is made up of different image bands. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in the field of image classification over the past few years because of their fast and very precise feature extraction skills and continuously qualified network frameworks. CNN architecture comprises a series of hidden layers, with input and an output layer.

Nothing is better than wine analysis because wine is one the most likable products in the market which is consumed by over 60% of the population around the world. \r\nIn our project, Wine Analysis has been achieved by using the Machine Learning (ML). This method is been considered as it save a lot of time; one person can do the analysis as it is easy to use, once it is understood and not a million bunch of people is required to do so, all the required data can be acquired in the form of bar plot, which is needful for the organization and also in a data can be retrieved in a statistical form. Here, the analysis has been done by getting the dataset from the freely available website i.e. kaggle. Herein from Kaggle, various no. of datasets can be downloaded that too for free as it is an open source. Wine Analysis is been taken into consideration because a number of steps is been followed to make one wine and into a lot of procedures it goes through, that too takes years and years to taste it better. This happens as wine takes years to sweeten by taste. However, the ingredients used in that particular wine should also be as such it should not make wine bitter or poisonous. Analysis is the a must to be done for avoiding further such situations.\r\nAnalysis can be done by the requirements of the organization; it can be a bar-plot or a bar graph. It could also be an accuracy percentile (%) which is much easier to read and understand (out of 100%). Machine Learning is one of the most popular methods which have now growing as a field of analysis and data recognition. Data visualization and analysis helps the customers to understand what exact % of ingredients and certain alcohol is present or absent. This analysis and visualization gives a better understanding and prediction of the further procedures which could be held according to that criterion.\r\nIn summary, data visualization is a crucial step to improve the understanding by manual acceptance.

Let me start by thanking you for the opportunity to apply for this position.\r\nI have a few years of experience working as a freelance writer at Livingston Research. This organization provides personal educational support to students. I  was introduced to innovative and creative content development practices aligned with academic writing terminologies, such as frameworks, interdisciplinary views, and professional insights. I managed to build a good reputation for myself. I was able to produce my material within the set time frame.\r\nI also have good technical writing skills. I can write content widely on information technology and software from Linux, Python, PHP, Kubernetes, Dockers, Windows Servers, Git, Qubes, OpenStack, Node.js, and others.\r\n\r\nMy commitment to academic writing also ensured that the work I produced meets basic expectations of the market standards and quality required.\r\nFor instance, the recent assignment that earned me money was done within 12 hours. I did mention in my resume that I would prioritize content development over everything else.\r\nAs a source of reference, I have a Bachelor in Telecommunication from the University of Ilorin, Kwara state, and I am an IT Team Leader at Royal Media Group. I have a website himosoft.com where I regularly write articles on various IT challenges facing organizations in society.
