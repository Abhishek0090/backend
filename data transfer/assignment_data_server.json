I chose influencer marketing as a topic but compared it to celebrity endorsements. I want to look at whether brands are promoting influencers more and if there is a decline in celebrity endorsements. We are free to write the dissertation however we like as long as it fits the academic standard (I have uploaded guidelines) Some topics I would like to include would be diffusion of innovation model, priming, nudging and more. I have completed a literature review and want the paper to have secondary information but will be conducting an interview with a CEO of a marketing agency. I will provide that as well.

Need for this study arises because there are approximately 50-55 higher secondary educational institutions in Vadodara and only 2 schools offer Entrepreneurship as an elective subject. I personally believe that entrepreneurship is a very strong and empowering course and it benefits everyone. Even if we don\u2019t master\r\nthis course, everyone should at-least have a basic understanding of this subject. ",

    "description": "Defining The Problem: \r\n\r\nMy client Mr. Rajendra Agarwal is the sole owner of a company called Paolo \r\n\r\nScali which is a wholesaling business of ready-made male garments. My \r\n\r\nclient buys the fabric from a third party and give it to manufacturers who have \r\n\r\nbeen informed by us about the design required and then after the garments \r\n\r\nare manufactured and sold to retailers. The client is facing problems with the \r\n\r\nthe inventory of garments. The client has lost many transactions over the years as \r\n\r\nwell as the name of the retailers he sold them to all over the country which makes it difficult to contact those retailers for potential business opportunities. As the client is in the wholesaling business, he deals with quantities in the high hundreds and sometimes even thousands for a particular garment, and as the client has no digital framework to keep track of these garments it makes it difficult to know as to how much of a particular colour or a sample of a garment is remaining. The client also cannot keep track of whether or not only the designated person has entered the details in the book containing inventory and garments. And does not know if any details have been falsified. The client also has trouble recording the attendance of his employees, the client\u2019s employees are only entitled to 8 days of holidays apart from festive seasons and they are subject to lose their salary if they exceed the 8-day limit.\r\n\r\nRationale \u2013 The major \r\n\r\nproblems Mr. Rajendra and his company was facing was the attendance \r\n\r\nrecord of his employees and the amount of garments that were sold in which \r\n\r\nsize and colour. I have decided to make a software that will enable him to keep track of all these things such as customer names, garments sold, colour of garment sold and the size. The software will also include a feature where Mr. Rajendra can mark the attendance of an employee. \r\n\r\nTo create the following project, I will utilise NetBeans (Java OOP). Java \r\nprogrammes are interoperable with any operating system, making them easy to run on my client's computer. NetBeans will let me import both built-in and third-party libraries, which will speed up the development process. Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are all ideas that Java will allow me to use which will further enhance the software. Java also includes a number of features that will allow me to integrate my product with other software, such as the MySQL Database Management System (DBMS). Because it is a free application that runs on every OS and is exceptionally compatible with NetBeans, this is the best database administration software.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Final year project(Automatic Waste Segregation)",
    "description": "The process starts with customer or user placing waste object in a slot provided in the front \r\nface of the machine and then waste object is sensed with help of sensors and categorized using \r\nflaps which rotate using servomotor. These motors are operated using Arduino which takes input \r\nfrom sensors used for detecting various waste materials one at a time. the sensors used in this \r\nproject are inductive proximity sensors for metal detection and moisture sensor for classification \r\nin dry and wet waste category \r\n When consumer puts waste in the AWS, the sensor gives information to Arduino about \r\npresence of waste in sensing region. Arduino then turns on inductive proximity sensor which \r\nidentifies If the waste is made up of metallic material then sends positive or negative input to \r\nArduino. When a metal target enters the magnetic field created by coil, eddy current circulates \r\nwithin the target. This causes load on the sensor which decreases the oscillator\u2019s amplitude. As \r\nthe target reaches close to the sensor further the oscillator\u2019s amplitude decreases, this fluctuation \r\nof oscillator is detected in inductive proximity sensors. If the waste is not detected as metallic \r\nthen another sensor is activated which is moisture sensor, used for sensing moisture content in \r\nthe material to classify waste object as dry & wet waste. Sensor measures moisture content in \r\nthe waste, if the moisture content is above a pre-set threshold value set by manufacturer, then \r\nthe waste is declared as wet waste else it is classified as dry waste. After classification of \r\nwaste as dry, wet & metallic, the input is given to Arduino which is giving input to servomotors \r\nwhich are operating simultaneously to send waste in proper bin assigned for it using two flaps. \r\nOne flap will rotate in X-Y plane and other will rotate in Y-Z plane. Each flap eliminates one \r\nbin at a time, two flaps will eventually eliminate two bins and finally object will be properly \r\nsent to preassigned bin for it. Both flaps will rotate simultaneously with certain time delay to \r\navoid collision between both flaps or to prevent waste from going in the wrong bucket. Time \r\ndelay will be pre mentioned in the coding of Arduino, angle of rotation of each flap will also be \r\nnoted in code. All these values will be calculated pre-fabrication, so that we can design compact \r\nand sophisticated machine. After waste is collected in the bin assigned for it, the ultrasonic \r\nsensors is applied in the bins for detection of level of bins. Ultrasonic sensors work by sending \r\nout a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. The transducer of the sensor \r\nacts as a microphone to receive and send the ultrasonic sound. Ultrasonic sensors like many \r\nothers, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo. The sensor determines \r\nthe distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the \r\n22 \/ 29\r\nultrasonic pulse. If the distance is less than the threshold distance mentioned by programmer, \r\nthe buzzer will ring notifying the operator that bin is full. Fully filled bins are then removed by \r\noperator and then sent to municipal corporations for further processing such as disposal, recycle \r\nor reuse based on the composition and properties of material used for that particular object, then\r\nempty bins are again placed in the AWS. Same process will take place every time.",

The  user provides his fingerprint together with his identity information like his PIN-CODE.  The fingerprint verification system retrieves the fingerprint template according to the  PIN-CODE and matches the template with the real time acquired fingerprint from the  user. Usually it is the underlying design principle of AFAS (Automatic Fingerprint  Authentication System). Fingerprint identification is to specify one person\u2019s identity by  his fingerprint(s). Without knowledge of the person\u2019s identity, the fingerprint identification system tries to match his fingerprint(s) with those in the whole fingerprint  database. It is especially useful for criminal investigation cases. And it is the design  principle of AFIS (Automatic Fingerprint Identification System). However, all  fingerprint recognition problems, either verification or identification, are ultimately  based on a well-defined representation of a fingerprint. \r\n\r\n",

This does not include your list of references. \r\no\tI really mean 3,000 words as a maximum \u2013 there is no +10%!  \r\n\u2022\tWhile you have some leeway to interpret your chosen question as you see fit, make sure your approach engages with core course material. One major aim of the essay is to gauge the extent to which you have internalized key ideas in readings and lectures. So make sure your essay satisfies this. \r\n\u2022\tTheory is especially important.\r\n\u2022\tWrite as if your intended reader was a generally intelligent and informed non-expert. Do not assume key ideas; instead explain them clearly from first principles. If they are crucial, be sure to go in sufficient depth.\r\n\u2022\tFollow appropriate referencing and bibliography. In seeking sources, a useful starting point would be the reading lists provided for this course. A logical next step for deepening your knowledge would be the bibliographies of those works.\r\n\u2022\tThe use of a wide variety of relevant academic (ie peer-reviewed) sources is expected. \r\n\u2022\tThere is no magic \u2018right\u2019 number of sources, and quality is preferred over quantity.\r\n\u2022\tClarity of expression is very important. If English is not your first language, make sure to have your paper proofread by a native speaker.  SBM has a writing tutor \u2013 Kyla Sankey, who can help. \r\n\u2022\tEssay structure matters. Make sure your introduction indicates your thesis. Have a plan, make it explicit to the reader, and follow it.\r\n\u2022\tHaving a well-articulated thesis statement in your introduction will help to structure your argument and provide a roadmap to the reader. If you are not well-practiced in writing thesis statements, I suggest you seek guidance. SBM\u2019s writing tutor will be helpful. Online sources might also help, such as\r\no\thttps:\/\/writingcenter.unc.edu\/tips-and-tools\/thesis-statements\/\r\no\thttps:\/\/www.servicescape.com\/blog\/25-thesis-statement-examples-that-will-make-writing-a-breeze",

So whenever you come in the college with your vehicle, the sensor will detect you and also ask for a PASSWORD.. Once you have given the correct password , you can go and park your vehicle and the lcd will show that now only 49 slots are left... (-1 of your car ) and when you leave the exit sensor will sense your car and the counter will go back to 50 (+1 ) (since that parking space is now available) Now the thing is I have to implement the same in ISE DESIGN SUITE and i have to implement it\/ burn it on the spartan 6 board",

    "title": "What are Indian parents\\ perceptions of their adolescent athletes\\ career trajectory into elite sports? ",
    "description": "I need an introduction and literature review to be written by EOD. Max words- 1000. If 1000 words aren't enough to include everything mentioned below, then you can go +500, but not more than that. PLEASE WRITE ONLY SUBSTANTIVE STUFF IN THE MOST PROFESSIONAL MANNER.\r\nThis assignment is part of my dissertation so I'd request your best writer to indulge in it.\r\n\r\nBroad topic: Parents' involvement in their children's sports participation.\r\nResearch question: What are Indian parents' perceptions of their adolescent athletes' career trajectory in elite sports? \r\nBasically, what my dissertation will focus on: the psychosocial influences that operate within parents which ultimately contribute to their child's career outcome in sports.\r\n\r\nResearch has suggested that parents, rather than teachers\/coaches\/instructors, are the most influential social factors in childrens\u2019 sports involvement.  \r\nResearch over the years has proved that Sports have much more to offer than what we are currently utilizing. Sports help in building the character and personality of a person, besides being an excellent medium for instilling values like discipline, respect, team spirit, decision making, and keeping depression at bay among many others.\r\nThough it has been established that sport has so many benefits, very few Indian parents involve their kids in sports participation.\r\nAmongst the lot that does as well, there are very few parents who encourage their children to take up a sport as a career (after high school- transitional into college).\r\nWE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES THE PARENTS TAKE THIS DECISION APART FROM THE SOCIAL FACTORS (eg. finances, a sport not being considered a career, low govt funding, sport politics, caste etc)\r\nWE WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE INDIAN SUBCULTURE AFFECTS PARENTS DECISION MAKING ON HOW THEY SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN OR NOT SUPPORT (the psychosocial reasons)\r\nWe will understand this via a theoretical model of parental involvement in sport- Teques & Serpa's model which was based on Hoover- Dempsey and Sandler's model. You will need to link the theory and parental influences- MOST IMP. \r\nI am attaching four papers that I have read. I will request that you use more papers that are mentioned in their references. Papers by Chris Hardwood are a huge plus point if used.\r\n\r\nOverall, India has a good amount of talented kids playing sports at the sub-elite level. Having said that, this does not show up in high-level tournaments like the Olympics. India has the worst per head medal tally at the Olympics. We want to see how parents play a role in this as they are the most influential models in children's sports involvement. Through the lit review, and eventually the paper, I want to try and figure out the parental side of things and how they support their child from moving into elite level sport, that is, choosing a career in sport. And how my study can help understand parents cope with stress and how we can minimize the dropout rates of potentially the next generation of sports athletes and eventually better the medal tally at big tournaments like the Olympics.\r\n",

Reich.  \r\n\r\nAnother counter argument to this claim was \"They Are Not Us: Why American Ownership Still Matters\" by Laura Tyson at the start of 21st Century. Which claims how ownership of a firm is important. \r\n\r\nIn the essay we need to write about how the thinking of ownership of a multinational not being important according to Robert B. Reich at the end of 20th Century is not irrelevant in today's time. And how the ownership of a multinational firm is becoming more and more important. \r\n\r\nConcluding with -  in today's time , who can we consider \"Us\".\r\n",

This will be one of three broad types:\r\nA.\tA primary research based empirical study; \r\nFor this type of project your starting point will typically be from a gap or problem that arises from academic theory.  Your rationale will identify the gap or problem in the theory; your intended audience is likely to be academic and the conclusions will have a more academic and theoretical focus.  \r\nB.\tA desk-based project to include a literature review along with further analysis of secondary data;\r\nThis will require you to have access to a suitable existing data set but will not involve the collection of primary data.\r\nC.\tAn organisation-based research project.\r\nThis type of project has a more practical focus similar to a consultancy type of research.  The research could be for an organisation that you have approached, or could be for the organisation that you work for.  In the past some students have used their research project to undertake research as a foundation for a business enterprise or venture that they are planning.  Your rationale will identify the practical issue or problem which needs addressing and your introduction will provide the context to your organisation. Your intended audience will be practitioners and the conclusions will focus on practical recommendations rather than theoretical developments.  \r\nWhichever form is selected the Research Project report must include a critical review of relevant literature and a critical appraisal of the methodology selected.  \r\nYou will be advised on the most suitable type of project for your topic area during the research methods module and in the initial discussions with your supervisor.\r\n\tThe structure and style of the project submitted should be appropriate to its intended outcomes. Outlined below are the key stages of tackling a large project.  Your work should include these stages but, depending on the topic of study and the research design, the emphasis between them may vary. \r\nBefore looking at each of the stages in more detail it is vital not to deal with too wide a subject. The more closely the investigation can be defined the better will be the chance of achieving the learning outcomes (and a good mark).  \r\nYou should also note that you are expected to analyse and explain issues associated with the phenomenon being studied, rather than merely describing them. \r\nNormally, the project is written in an impersonal style (ie not using the first person, \u2018I\u2019). However, where you use certain methodologies it may be permissible to refer to yourself in the first person.\r\n\tAim and Objectives \r\n\tState the aim and objectives of your study i.e. what is the purpose of the project. \r\n\tState your objectives in such a way that you can measure the extent to which they have been achieved. You may have a proposal (hypothesis) that is capable of being tested or you may have identified a research problem to investigate or a research question to answer. \r\n\tAlso it is very important to ensure that the aim and objectives defined are achievable within the scope of the research project (timescale, data availability and number of words).\r\n\tIntroduction and Approach\r\n\tThe introduction sets the context for the study. This covers the rationale behind the choice of topic and the overall approach to the work and how it is structured.  In other words it includes the justification for your aim and objectives and an overview of how you go about achieving them.  Decide what information is needed to achieve the aim and objectives and how you are going to collect it. Do not include areas that are not related to the topic. \r\n\tReview of Theory and Literature Survey\r\n\tThis stage requires an investigation and discussion of past and current research\/literature on your topic. To do this you should read and summarise relevant information on the topic. This literature review must be used to develop a theoretical framework for your work. It will vary according to the type of study that you are undertaking. However, an apparent lack of literature probably means that the topic is unsuitable for a research project. \r\n\tThe role of the literature survey can be summarised as follows:\r\n\u2022\tTo help further clarify the purpose of your research and contribute to a rationale for the work.\r\n\u2022\tProvide a thorough examination of the relevant literature, so giving you a full understanding of the topic.\r\n\u2022\tClearly identify and define the theoretical concepts and\/or frameworks to be used in the work.\r\n\u2022\tTo provide a context for your research by placing your specific topic in the literature and showing how your work relates to that already existing.\r\n\u2022\tIdentify and analyse the relationships between ideas that make up the framework for your study.\r\n\u2022\tProvide a basis for your methodological choices\r\n\r\nIn order to do this it is necessary to look for and summarise areas of agreement and disagreement and contradictory evidence and analyse and evaluate theory and evidence with reference to the objectives of your study. \r\nA literature review should be comprehensive, current, critical and clearly focused on your objectives. It should cover the full range of literature available that relates to your topic. It is a requirement of a literature review that you use academic and research literature from journals, books, papers and government publications. Online research databases such as \u2018Discover\u2019 provided by the library will enable you to search a wide variety of sources relatively easily.\r\nFollow the guidelines on referencing for the Leeds Beckett Harvard system. Also, wherever possible, you should refer to work read rather than overuse direct quotations (ask your supervisor if you are still unsure about the difference between direct and indirect quoting or paraphrasing). Also see the section on referencing below.\r\nAt this stage of the process your objectives will probably undergo some refinement or your research problem\/question(s) will become more precise.\r\nOne of the key challenges of the research project is to produce a coherent and holistic piece of work in which all the sections link together and are clearly focused on the aim and objectives. This is obviously important throughout but especially so in establishing the relationship between the literature review and any primary research or secondary data analysis undertaken.\r\nThis should be discussed in detail with your supervisor but the basic principles are that:\r\n\u2022\tYour literature review is concluded effectively and you are clear about the findings and how they relate to the aims and objectives.\r\n\u2022\tThe findings of your literature review are clearly and explicitly used to inform the methodology and, hence, the primary research.\r\n\u2022\tThe data sought from the primary research is properly identified and is derived from and related to the literature review findings. \r\n\u2022\tThe methods used to carry out the research are appropriate and relevant to the findings of the literature review and the data sought. \r\n\r\nResearch Design and Methodology\r\nIt is important to develop an effective methodology and to understand why your methodology is appropriate to this particular study. Consideration should therefore be given to the best methods to use to address the research problem or question that you have identified.\r\nYour method will vary with the type of study, but you will probably need to collect or locate data and analyse them.  This may well involve you in primary research (collecting data for the specific purposes of your project).  It does not, however, have to take this form. It may be possible to use existing data in a way that is new to this study.\r\nIt is expected that you will deal with the following elements in this stage of the research project:\r\n\u2022\tThe specific purpose of this part of the process and how it contributes to the overall aims and objectives of the work.\r\n\u2022\tThe choice of research approach (primary\/secondary \u2013 qualitative\/quantitative).\r\n\u2022\tThe choice of sample \u2013 size, characteristics and selection method.\r\n\u2022\tIf using primary data the methods used to collect the data and the precise design of any instruments used (interview schedules, questionnaires, observation checklists etc.).\r\n\u2022\tIf using secondary data a critique of the collection method and awareness of any limitations\r\n\u2022\tTechniques used to analyse the data (again qualitative or quantitative).\r\n\u2022\tCritical evaluation of each of these factors.\r\nThe research methods module will have introduced a variety of data gathering techniques and associated means of analysis.  It is important that you are able to honestly criticise the methodology you have used, in the light of the outcomes and your original objectives. For example, how reliable and\/or valid are the results? Are the measurements accurate? Is there any bias? etc. No research is perfect and the ability to reflect on your own research practice is an important part of becoming a good researcher.\r\n\r\nWHATEVER METHOD YOU ADOPT, YOU MUST NOT APPROACH ANY OUTSIDE BODY OR SEND OUT ANY POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRES UNLESS THE ETHICS COORDINATOR AND YOUR SUPERVISOR HAVE GIVEN PERMISSION AND YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL THE NECESSARY ETHICS FORMS (AVAILABLE VIA Leeds Beckett Ethics Online). \r\nThis requirement applies equally to interviews with members of the public (such as street interviews) as to any other form of data gathering. These individuals may be contacted by tutors, as a means of verifying the data you attribute to them.  If potential participants wish to retain anonymity, you must explain to them that their identity will only be shared with tutors.\r\nPrimary Research Requirements\r\nPast experience has shown that the majority of students elect to undertake some form of primary research. This helps to support\/test the findings of their reading and to draw effective and realistic conclusions for their work. \r\nWhen carrying out research it is vital that you conduct it professionally and ethically. \r\nVerification: In the past we have had some students who have been unable to verify the source(s) of their data or the way in which it was collected. As a result of this you MUST meet the requirements outlined below. \r\nAlthough this detail may not be presented in your research project due to issues of confidentiality and anonymity you must make sure that you keep records of the following in line with the University\u2019s research ethics policy. \r\n\r\n1.\tRecords of all sources of data.\r\n2.\tIdentify your sources including as much of the following information as possible;\r\n\u2022\tName and addresses of individuals contacted.\r\n\u2022\tTheir position within the organisation.\r\n\u2022\tThe address of the organisation head office\r\n\u2022\tDates & times of contacts.\r\n3.\tSigned consent forms\r\n4.\tThe use of questionnaires carried out on a random basis in the street is usually discouraged in the project. Your supervisor is likely to ask you to look for alternative methods if you are considering this as an approach. If you do use this approach you must still collect as much of the data as possible from each respondent.\r\n\r\nIt is the intention of staff involved in the research project to follow up a random sample of primary research to confirm the information presented is accurate.\r\nEthics: the University\u2019s policy on research ethics is quite clear. All research should conform to some basic principles:\r\n1.\tBeneficence \u2013 \u2018do positive good\u2019 and\r\n2.\tNon-maleficence \u2013 \u2018do no harm\u2019\r\n\tThe research should be assessed for potential risks concerning participants \u2013 the interests of subjects and participants in the research should always come before those of the research itself.\r\n3.\tInformed consent of participants\r\n\tAll participants should be given full and accurate information in order for them to decide whether to take part in the research or not. Example of Information sheet can be found on MyBeckett. \r\n4.\tConfidentiality & anonymity\r\n\tExplicit consent must be gained from participants in order to publish any information that may enable them to be identified. Examples of Consent forms can be found on MyBeckett. \r\n\t(if the research involves a questionnaire then the consent form can be built into this, rather than requiring  a separate consent form)\r\nPlease refer to the separate guidance on \u201cEthical clearance for research undertaken by students\u201d and submit the appropriate forms online as indicated via your MyBeckett module. \r\nClick here to submit your research ethics forms online https:\/\/researchethics.leedsbeckett.ac.uk\/auth?redirect=%2F \r\nETHICS FORMS MUST BE SUBMITTED AND APPROVED BEFORE ANY PRIMARY RESEARCH IS UNDERTAKEN. WE RECOMMEND THIS IS DONE AT LEAST EIGHT WEEKS BEFORE YOUR SUBMISSION DATE.\r\nAny student without final ethics approval performing primary research or submitting work that includes primary research will be subject to investigation for unfair practice under the University Academic Regulations Section 10: Academic Integrity.\r\nBefore you begin your research; whether using primary sources (human subjects such as consumers, event managers, company employees etc.) or secondary sources (TripAdvisor comments, newspapers or company websites etc.) you must complete your Research Ethics forms online, have your Research Ethics forms approved by your supervisor and then approved by the Local Research Ethics Coordinator\r\nPlease read the Leeds Beckett University Research Policy https:\/\/www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk\/-\/media\/files\/policies\/research-and-enterprise\/upre_research_ethics_policy.pdf\r\nData Presentation, Analysis and Discussion\r\nPresent the data professionally, logically and clearly. There are two different methods suggested for this; either present your main findings separate from any analysis or discussion, or present your findings and discussion together. \r\nAs a general guideline it is likely that the former will be more appropriate for quantitative data and the latter for qualitative data. This is a guide not a rule you must follow, there will always be instances when either approach is appropriate. Make sure you discuss this with your supervisor.\r\nThe form of data analysis undertaken will vary according to how the project has been approached. Thus some research projects may involve highly quantitative analysis whereas others may utilise qualitative methods.  The research methods programme will introduce you to various data analysis techniques.  \r\nThe analysis needs to be appropriate for the study. For example, simple descriptive analysis may be acceptable in some instances but more sophisticated inferential analysis may be more appropriate and improve the quality of your findings. However you need to plan this in advance as collection of the wrong or insufficient data will make it difficult or impossible to conduct the required level of analysis. \r\nDiscussion of the significance of your results should consider:\r\n\u2022\tcomparisons with similar research and findings in the literature;\r\n\u2022\tto what extent the data confirms or detracts from any theoretical framework developed in the literature review and\/or used in your research;\r\n\u2022\twhether your data collection methods may have affected the results;\r\n\u2022\tpractical and theoretical implications for firms, management, government bodies etc.\r\nThis section gives you the opportunity to evaluate your findings in context and thereby demonstrate your skills of evaluation, analysis and synthesis.\r\nConclusions and Recommendations\r\nConclusions (and possibly recommendations) are the final part of your work. They should follow naturally from the work done to this point and should summarise the key issues emerging from your work and set it in a wider context.  Is it possible, for example, to generalise on the basis of your findings? You conclusion should do this without bringing in any new arguments. Keep it concise and focused on the implications of your findings. \r\nDepending on the nature of the subject matter, you may wish to offer recommendations. These may be for the industry in terms of future action or for researchers considering a similar topic. \r\nIt is appropriate for you to suggest other, related, avenues for further consideration. This is not an afterthought to be tacked on to the end of the research project; it is a key element of the work that should not be left to the last minute. \r\nReferences \r\nAll sources of information to which you refer must be cited using the Harvard referencing convention. You should already be fully conversant with this style; if not full guidelines are available in the library or on the intranet.  \r\nThe reference list should not be a general list of publications on the topic. Only include those references to which you refer in the text, do not include sources read but not directly referred to.\r\nLast word\r\nThe better projects do not merely follow a linear process and are not a \u2018diary\u2019 of what you did. The finished written work represents a completed solution to (or recommendations for) an identified problem. This means that you will revisit all sections of the written work throughout the module possibly revising your aim and objectives at the end of the process. With this in mind do not use the future tense but write as though you have completed the work. Past or present tense is appropriate.\r\n4.2.2\tFurther Assessment Details\r\nAssessment for the research project is based on the final completed thesis.\r\nYou will have had guidance about how to write your proposal for the Project within Research Methods. \r\nOnce proposals have been submitted they will usually be reviewed by the Course Research Project Co-ordinator and any appropriate colleagues for context specific elements. After reviewing your proposal you will be allocated a supervisor.\r\nYou must make arrangements to discuss with them immediately to start the research process. Where the proposal has not been passed you may be required to make changes before you start on your research. \r\nThe proposed title may change during the course of the work as might the methods employed or even the specific objectives. \r\nChanging topics part way through will severely limit the time available and you are unlikely to achieve the necessary standard of work.  Any request for alteration of the topic must be channelled through your Supervisor to the Course Research Project Co-ordinator.\r\nAssessment of the research project will be based on the criteria listed later in this section.  Each project will be double marked (supervisor plus one other member of staff) and the final mark may be the subject of scrutiny by the external examiner. \r\nThere may also be a confirmatory viva voce (interview) if necessary.\r\n\r\n4.2.3\tGuidance on formatting your Masters Research Project\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTyping should be one and a half line-spaced, except for extended quotations, which should be single-spaced and indented. \r\n\u2022\tThe left-hand margin should be a minimum of 40mm, and the remaining margins should be at least 20mm. \r\n\u2022\tThe font should be 12 point except for headings and titles. \r\n\u2022\tTyping can be double sided.  \r\n\u2022\tAll pages should be numbered.\r\n\r\nAt the front of the project there should be:\r\na)\ta title page giving: \r\n\uf071\tthe title of the research project, which should give a clear indication of the content\r\n\uf071\tyour name\r\n\uf071\tthe name of your course, for example  \u201cMSc International Events Management\" \r\n\uf071\tthe words \u201cLeeds Beckett University\u201d\r\n\uf071\tthe month and year of submission\r\n\r\n\r\nExample: \t\t\t\t\t   Title\r\nName\r\nPresented as part of the requirement for the award of the\r\nMSc\/MA in \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\r\nLeeds Beckett University\r\nMonth, Year\r\n\r\na)\ta declaration page with the wording:\r\nI, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 confirm that the work contained in this research project is my own work. It has not been previously published or submitted for assessment elsewhere.\r\nI confirm that all other sources of information have been acknowledged in line with the regulations for referencing.\r\nI confirm that I have fully complied with all University regulations regarding plagiarism and unfair practice.\r\nI confirm that the word count for the dissertation is XXXX\r\nName:    \r\nSignature:    ____________________ Date: ____________\r\n\r\nb)\tan acknowledgements\/dedications page (if desired).\r\nc)\tan abstract of approximately 250 words outlining the main arguments\r\nd)\ta contents page listing the page numbers of all sections\/chapters \r\nand including , if appropriate\r\n-\ta list of tables \r\n-\ta list of figures, including maps, diagrams, photographs, etc.\r\ne)\ta list of appendices (to include evidence of ethical approval).\r\n\r\nThe nature of the content will inevitably vary depending upon the individual study.  However, each project should normally include:\r\n\uf071\ta background to the issue, explaining why it is important;\r\n\uf071\ta clear statement of the research problem;\r\n\uf071\ta review of relevant literature;\r\n\uf071\tdetails of the methodology used;\r\n\uf071\tthe findings;\r\n\uf071\tanalysis and interpretation;\r\n\uf071\tconclusions and recommendations or implications (possibly for theory, practice, policy, further research)\r\n\uf071\tA bibliography of references (in Harvard style and only those you have referred to in the text.)\r\n\r\n\tNumbering of pages begins with the Introduction to the report itself and not with the Title page, Acknowledgements and Contents. These pages are known as \u201cPrelims\u201d and if numbered should be given a different numbering from the main text e.g. (i) (ii) (iii) etc.  (The title page should not be numbered.) Numbering should be at the bottom centre of each page.\r\nThe length of the research project should be a maximum of 14,000 words (excluding appendices). The word count starts at your introduction and finishes after your recommendations\r\n\r\n\tIt is considered part of the discipline of the Research Project to work within this word limit.  Please pay attention to the maximum word-length for your assignment. You will not be penalised if you go slightly over the limit (up to 10%) but learning to write concisely is part of the discipline of producing a good, focussed essay or report. If your assignment is over-long we will not mark it and your work will be recorded as a non-submission.  Appendices should be used sparingly, essential information should be included within the word count as content in the appendices is not assessed.  The word limit excludes the list of references, appendices and assignment cover sheets.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe criteria for assessing the project are identified in Appendix B.  Your research project will, therefore, be assessed on the extent to which it demonstrates:\r\n\u2022\tThe clarity of the rationale and focus. The level of internal consistency and the logical development of information to sustain arguments linking the research rationale, literature and findings indicating a high level of critical awareness of strengths and limitations of the research. Clarity of analysis and evaluation;\r\n\u2022\tA comprehensive literature research and\/or study of background information consistent with the stated aim of the research project;\r\n\u2022\tAn advanced understanding of the conceptual and theoretical perspectives and appreciation of methodological issues related to the research topic and has constructively criticised all major viewpoints illustrating awareness of strengths and limitations;\r\n\u2022\tThat the analysis and\/or discussion of the collected data or information is logically sound and is relevant to an evaluation of any hypothesis offered and the degree to which the aims have been fulfilled;\r\n\u2022\tThat the presentation of the research project is in the approved manner with reference to format, argument, statistical information and analysis, appendices and referencing;\r\n\u2022\tThe project is demonstrably the student's own work.\r\n\r\nKeeping in contact with your supervisor provides you with an opportunity to ensure that you are approaching your project in a manner that will increase your likelihood of meeting the assessment criteria.\r\n\r\nStudent Instructions for Submission of Coursework \r\nThis module requires you to submit your work online.\r\nYou MUST submit your work through MyBeckett using the link set up by the tutor. Receipt of your work will be recorded.\r\nYour \"Turnitin assignments\" in MyBeckett can be set up so that you can check your assignment yourself as you submit it. This checking is done by creating a \"Similarity Report\".  If this report shows that there are some problems with your work, such as un-cited quotations, you should be able to make corrections and re-submit the work again before the due date. More information about Turnitin is available online here: http:\/\/libguides.leedsbeckett.ac.uk\/mybeckett\/turnitin\r\n\r\nPlease note: Tutors will follow up any suspected breach of academic integrity found after the submission date as per University policy. Late penalties will apply as per University Regulations.\r\n\r\nParticular Instructions to Students\r\nPlease read carefully the assessment and grade\/marking descriptors overleaf:\r\n \r\nCourse Title(s): \tMSc International Events Management \/ MSc Sports Events Management \/ MSc Responsible Tourism Management \/ MSc Experiential Event Marketing\r\nModule Title:\tMasters Research Project\tLevel:\t7\r\nAssessment Title:\tMasters Research Project\tWeighting: \t100%\r\n\r\nCriteria and Weighting\t100-70\r\nExcellent\t69-60 \r\nGood\t59-50\r\nSatisfactory\t49-40\r\nPoor\t39-0\r\nFail\r\nRationale, aims and objectives\r\n\r\n\tExcellently articulated and evidenced rationale, background & context.\r\nA novel and legitimate aim with appropriate objectives detailing what will be achieved\tRationale, background & context very clear and evidenced through reference to a range of sources.\r\nA clear aim and appropriate objectives \tRationale, background & context clear and evidenced through reference to a range of sources.\r\nAim detailed with achievable objectives\tRationale, background & context included but lacking clarity\/purpose.

    "title": "Essay ",
    "description": "As a reminder, here are the requirements for your second essay:\r\n\r\n\"The remainder of the term will be devoted to a longer researched essay, running five-to-eight pages in length.\u202fStudents should use no fewer than eight (8) sources, two of which should be from peer-reviewed publications \r\n\r\nAs before, students should be encouraged to propose their own topics and devise original projects tailored to their future disciplines and\/or current interests.\" \r\n\r\nBefore submitting your final draft, do the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Edit the draft for wordiness. Take a critical look at each sentence and trim out as many words as you can without losing the meaning. Wordy sentences contain many unnecessary words. These sentences feel \u201cwatered down\u201d\u2014like you have to do a lot of work to gain a little information.\r\n\r\nGood writing is dense and concise; the words in the sentence work hard. Consider the following revisions:\r\n\r\nWordy: A few inches of snow on the ground is all that is necessary in order for a person to be able to go sledding.\r\n\r\nBetter: A few inches of snow is necessary to go sledding.\r\n\r\nWordy: All of the students who are new to this school are required to attend a meeting that has been scheduled for Friday the 22nd of September.\r\n\r\nBetter: New students are required to attend a meeting on Friday, September 22. \r\n\r\nNote: The problem with wordiness is not about the quantity of words; there is nothing wrong with a sentence having 25 or even 75 words as long as those words add information and detail. When reducing wordiness, be careful not to kill the richness and expressiveness of your writing.\r\n\r\nNot wordy: A bird with crimson wings glided from the jungle canopy and landed gracefully on a nearby rock.\r\n\r\nNot better: A bird flew from the trees to a rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Edit the draft for vague language. Look critically at your word choices and ask: Can I think of a more specific word for this?\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine you've written a sentence like this: \"In society, we often create interpersonal relationships with people who resonate with our values.\" Underlined are words that could definitely be more specific. Does the author mean society or 21st century America? Does he mean interpersonal relationships or friendships or love affairs or workplace collaborations? \r\n\r\nIf you can't get more specific, that's okay. But make sure you're using words like humans for a reason. Here are some usual suspects when it comes to vague language: They, Those, People, A Person, Individuals, Humans, Adults, Society, We, Us, One, Someone, Everybody, Anyone, Human Beings, Civilians, Citizens, Many, Early, Most, Others, Things, Stuff, Certain, Aspects, etc.\r\n\r\n3. See if you can do something about your overuse of the verb \"to be\" (is, am, was, etc.)\r\n\r\nI have a tendency to write with an abundance of these verbs:\r\n\r\nIt was morning when Jolene stepped into the forest. The sunlight and thick branches were above her, and wildflowers were by the trunks of the trees. There were many critters on the dirt road. This place was Jolene\u2019s favorite spot whenever she wanted time alone.\r\n\r\nBut through revision (with an emphasis on strong verbs) you can vary the language:\r\n\r\nAt morning, Jolene stepped into the forest. Sunlight shone down on thick branches, and wildflowers grew near the trunks of the trees. Critters scampered along the dirt road. Whenever Jolene wanted time alone, she came here.\r\n\r\n4. Do a search in your document for \"ly.\" This will help you track down most of your adverbs: \"quickly,\" \"urgently,\" \"desperately,\" etc. Typically eliminating adverbs and making your verbs stronger can help you reduce wordiness, vary language, and do all that other good stuff.\r\n\r\nBefore: \"He ran quickly.\"\r\n\r\nAfter: \"He bolted.\"\r\n\r\nSee? One word instead of two -- without losing meaning. Also \"bolted\" is a lot more specific and less mundane: excitement in writing.\r\n\r\n5. Add more in the way of analysis. After each quotation, you are meant to (1) make some original contribution and (2) connect the quotation's claim to your topic sentence.  \r\n\r\nLook to the passages of text that follow any quotation. Ask yourself critically: Have I said anything new here? Or am I merely repeating the ideas in the quotation? Try discussing what the author has neglected to consider in his\/her\/their quotation. Think up ways to take the argument further. Discuss unforeseen consequences and\/or benefits. \r\n\r\nIf you attempted to \"get done\" with your analysis in one quick sentence, that won't do. Lead substantial discussions on the page.",

The data file contains the target column, which represents the poverty level on a 1-4 scale. A value of 1 is the most extreme poverty.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nObjective\r\n\r\na) Predict poverty on a household level using ANN. Explain each steps clearly that you would carry out to develop the model.\r\n\r\nb)  Generate your confusion matrix\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe given data is on the individual level with each individual having unique features but also information about their household.\r\n\r\nWhile all members of a household should have the same label in the training data, there are errors where individuals in the same household have different labels. In these cases, you have to use the label for the head of each household, which can be identified by the rows where \u201cparentesco1 == 1.0.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome of the individuals belong to a household with no head of household, you need to discard those data for training\r\n\r\nThe Target values represent poverty levels as follows:\r\n\r\n1 = extreme poverty\r\n\r\n2 = moderate poverty\r\n\r\n3 = vulnerable households\r\n\r\n4 = non vulnerable households\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe explanations a few features are as follows:\r\n\r\n\u2022           Id: a unique identifier for each individual, this should not be a feature that we use!\r\n\r\n\u2022           idhogar: a unique identifier for each household. This variable is not a feature, but will be used to group individuals by household as all individuals in a household will have the same identifier.\r\n\r\n\u2022           parentesco1: indicates if this person is the head of the household.\r\n\r\n\u2022           Target: the label, which should be equal for all members in a household\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurther details can be found from the link below.\r\n\r\nSource: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction\/data",

In the starting only demographic variables like age, gender, highest qualification, region, imd band etc should be used for prediction where as at later points (i.e 20%, 40% etc) along with demographic variables make use of the click stream data i.e how many times student has accessed the videos and course materials how many times he has clicked on the course materials etc. Then later predictions will make use of information from the assessment scores along with demographic variables and click stream data. Once the predictions are made if the student is predicted to be at risk of failing then provide some intervention (like concentrate more, read more reference books, practice more problems etc)",

The neoclassical school would recommend laissez-faire capitalism, while Keynesian and Marxian schools envision a crucial role for the State in a capitalist economy. Discuss how the three schools differ in their understanding of the State's role in a modern capitalist economy.  (20 marks)\r\n \r\n \r\nQuestion A2. Critically discuss the notion of unemployment in neoclassical, Keynesian and Marxian theory. Describe in detail how the three schools differ in their understanding of the source of unemployment and its remedy. (20 marks)\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nSection B (2 X 15 = 30 marks)\r\nAnswer any two questions from section B\r\n \r\nWord limit for section B: 900 words per answer\r\n \r\nQuestion B1. How are wages and profits determined in neoclassical theory vis-\u00e0-vis Marxist economic theory? Describe and differentiate between the treatment of wages and profits in the two schools of thought. (15 marks)\r\n\r\nQuestion B2. In a recession, \"the government should pay people to dig holes in the ground and then fill them up.\" Explain this statement by Keynes using the contours of fiscal policy. (15 marks)\r\n \r\nQuestion B3. Kalecki argued that a government could ensure full employment even in a capitalist economy. Critically discuss Kalecki\u2019s explanation for why full employment is not reached or maintained in a capitalist economy. (15 marks)\r\n \r\nQuestion B4. Explain the concept of externality in neo-classical economics. Analyse how you think the environment could be affected by this concept and describe a couple of different solutions to the problem. Finally, how do you presume a Marxist would think about externalities (and market-failure in general) based on your knowledge of the Marxian theoretical tradition? (15 marks)\r\n ",

How the school teaches the readings and how that effects on the child\u2019s liking, hobby or disliking of the language learning. How the English readings are taught in Indian schools from childhood is very important so please include elaborated content on that. Also include a cultural and family aspect of the Indian household. On how that develops the language and reading of the child. How it encourages or diminished the interest in the child. For example, one of the parents reading the child every night before bed or even if that doesn\u2019t happen or there isn\u2019t a hands on physical encouragement there are still other ways like there is a library or a lot of books in the house. Even if the parents are not Avid readers, then encouraging their kid in some or other form or way. \r\nInternal factor, I guess includes the kids own interest. School, teachers, friends, parents, everyone plays an important role. Basically his English reading is developed in India or Indian kids from childhood to adulthood.",

    "description": "he proposal is an explanation of your topic and the gap in knowledge that your marketing research project will fill. There are three\r\nmain components to a research proposal:\r\nIn this section, you will be expected to explain the importance and implications of your chosen research topic. For example, if you are studying the impact of brands on consumer choice then you should discuss why brands are an important area of study and how you feel your research can improve our knowledge of the topic. Normally\r\nthis section will be reasonably short.\r\nYour literature review should build on the introduction to critically analyse what research currently exists about your topic. What is the gap your research will fill? Why is it an important topic? It should not just describe other relevant research but analyse and integrate existing work to help you frame and justify your topic, your research question, or the issue you want to explore, or the hypothesis you want to test. The literature review enables you to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the topic and should make up a significant chunk of your\r\nproposal. It also allows you to explain some of the key concepts and related studies in more depth.\r\nThe methodology section discusses how you wish to answer your research questions and hypotheses if applicable. If doing a qualitative research project, you will be identifying the phenomenon or issue you wish to investigate. You should discuss and justify the different methods you wish to employ for collecting and analysing data. Information about the sample being used and why you feel this is a good sample should also be included. Additional marks are available for examples of research instruments such as a sample questionnaire or set of interview questions, as well as some basic understanding of what analysis techniques may be useful. The key to this section is an appreciation for how you wish to go about your research and why you feel this is the best\r\napproach.\r\nNB! We do not expect you to collect any primary data as part of the research proposal! The proposal part is just\r\n that \u2013 a proposal to how and why you want to conduct the proposed research project.\r\n ",

    "description": "typical scientific paper has 4 parts.\r\n\r\nIntro\r\nMethod\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe intro discusses the theory and builds an argument for a specific alternative hypothesis. The method describes the variables, operational definitions, and procedures used in the study. The results talk about the statistics. The discussion interprets the results in words and discusses some interpretations of the findings.\r\n\r\nFor this assignment, I want you to write a two page (double spaced) discussion section of a paper. A discussion section typically has the parts listed below, and I expect to see these parts in your two page paper. Use these headings in your paper.\r\n\r\nSummary of hypothesis and results. State hypothesis and whether it was supported or not\r\nSummary of the theoretical implications. How does this advance the theory of norm of reciprocity?\r\nTheoretical implications help us answer questions such as \"how does this extend our understanding of the theory\" or \"does this suggest that the theory can be expanded or changed based on the research findings?\"  The theoretical implications often go a step further than simply stating that the research supports\/doesn't support the theory (because that's why the research was being conducted in the first place) and instead, might also suggest new pieces of the theory revealed by the evidence, confounding variables, or contexts in which the theory does not hold up.\r\nSummary of practical implications. What kind of practical advice would you be able to give someone based off of the study results?\r\nPractical implications help us answer questions such as \"what does this research mean in the real-world?\" or \"how would I apply this to an every day situation?\"\r\nLimitations. What are some things in the study that you would do differently if you could do the study again? \r\nFuture Directions. Suggest a study or a direction that future researchers could pursue to build on your work \r\n",

    "description": "For this assignment, you are required to analyse a small study and write up a research report. The word count for this assignment is 3000 words. \r\n\r\nIn this study, you are going to investigate one of the most interesting and significant psychological tests, the Emotional Stroop Test. This test aims to measure how emotional content can impact the time taken to select the colour (ink) of a word.\r\n\r\nBefore you get started on your assignment, you may wish to take part in an example Stroop Test that does not include any emotional words. This should help you to understand and become familiar with the basics of this experiment. \r\n\r\nA Stroop Test example showing a list of colours where participants would need to say the colour of the word, not what the word says.  \r\n\r\nAll students will be given a series of pre-collected participant responses and asked to analyse the data and write up the research report in the basis of the APA style. Please follow the next steps for completing the assignment.\r\n\r\nAnalysing the Experiment:\r\nThe Psychology Department has provided you with a summary report of scores, which you need to use for this assignment. These results have been gathered from an online Emotional Stroop Test where participants were shown a series of words and asked to select the colour of the word (ink) that appeared on their screen. \r\n\r\nParticipant\tAge\tSex\tTrial 1: \r\nNeutral 1 Response\tTrial 2: Neutral 2 Response\tTrial 3: Snake\tTrial 4: Social\tTrial 5: Death\tTrial 6: Eating\tTrial 7: Pain\tTrial 8: Public\tTrial 9: Defeat\r\n1\t31\tFemale\t9.970\t7.542\t12.620\t12.640\t11.520\t7.847\t8.636\t6.314\t11.973\r\n2\t23\tMale\t8.878\t9.929\t9.033\t6.947\t7.829\t7.127\t6.809\t6.809\t6.329\r\n3\t37\tFemale\t8.196\t6.735\t8.935\t8.455\t7.758\t8.234\t12.020\t9.300\t9.359\r\n4\t45\tMale\t10.040\t8.838\t9.974\t11.130\t11.130\t14.630\t14.684\t11.820\t9.446\r\n5\t53\tMale\t10.350\t12.910\t15.090\t12.080\t12.080\t14.900\t13.230\t13.760\t11.410\r\n6\t25\tFemale\t6.588\t6.887\t7.309\t6.937\t6.937\t7.171\t9.752\t9.752\t6.059\r\n7\t35\tMale\t9.191\t9.871\t9.963\t9.460\t9.460\t8.126\t8.686\t8.686\t11.530\r\n8\t47\tFemale\t12.410\t11.830\t11.190\t13.640\t13.640\t11.680\t14.820\t14.820\t13.930\r\n9\t33\tFemale\t10.690\t8.516\t8.549\t7.385\t7.385\t12.830\t11.780\t11.780\t14.970\r\n10\t39\tFemale\t7.531\t6.332\t9.425\t8.887\t8.887\t8.750\t12.400\t12.400\t11.231\r\nThe experiment was made up of nine trials that consisted of 12 words each. The first two trials contained 'Neutral Responses' (e.g. Chair, Desk, Umbrella) and the remaining trials were divided into seven themes. For example, Trial 3: Snake included words such as 'Poison' and 'Cobra'. Likewise, Trial 7: Pain included words such as 'Headache' and 'Bleeding'. \r\n\r\nOnce a word appeared on the screen, participants were asked to select the colour of the word (ink) by using the R, B, G and Y keys of their keyboard. 'R' stood for red, 'B' for blue, 'G' for green, and 'Y' for yellow. Once each trial was completed, the average time taken (seconds) to select the colour of the words in the list was recorded.\r\n\r\nDemographic data about the participants, as well as the average time taken to complete each trial, has been provided above. \r\n\r\nTo begin, you should review all of the results you are going to use and open an SPSS file. Next, you will need to input the data from the above table into a new dataset.\r\nYou will need to organise your data on the basis of their type (such as ordinal, nominal, etc.) and process your data accordingly and on the basis of what you have learned in the units.\r\nAnalyse your data by checking your Distribution and run any necessary Normality Tests.\r\nAnalyse Descriptive Statistics for all Trials.\r\nCompare the means between the following Trials using the appropriate t-test:\r\nA. Neutral (Trial 1) and Snake (Trial 3)\r\nB. Neutral (Trial 1) and Pain (Trial 7)\r\nC. Neutral (Trial 1) and Defeat (Trial 9)\r\nReport all your data on the basis of the APA style.\r\nReview the literature on the Emotional Stroop Test and start thinking about your own findings.\r\nInterpret your findings.\r\nWrite up your research report.\r\nWhat should I include in my report? \r\nYou will write up your findings in the conventional scientific report style with American Psychological Association referencing. Details of how these reports should be written can be found here. \r\n\r\nThe research report should reflect the following parts:\r\n\r\nAbstract \u2013 approx 150 words\r\nIntroduction \u2013 approx 1000 words which addressed the background theory and research on the Emotional Stroop test, the aim and the hypotheses of the study.\r\nMethods on the basis of the APA style. Please include any ethical considerations for this study. \r\nResults \u2013 tables should be included using APA style \u2013 the data should then be reported\r\nDiscussion - approx 1000 words which explains conclusions regarding the Emotional Stroop Test based on the research and the results of the t-test. The discussion should also suggest what could be done to further this study and explain why your suggestions would be valuable in the field.\r\nReferences \u2013 use APA style\r\nAppendices \u2013 include SPSS outputs\r\nAll sources should be cited using the APA style, and you should remember to discuss the theory and research of the Emotional Stroop Test, as well as describe and evaluate your findings in relationship to the theory and studies on the Emotional Stroop Test.\r\n\r\nPlease fully state and justify any other assumptions or choices that you make using the suggested resources of this unit, as well as your own research. Don't forget to include references to the sources that you have found yourself!",

Each reading reflection should engage critically with the required reading for the selected\r\nweek; as well as one additional reading from the weekly list. This should not be a summary; students should develop their own argument from the readings that discusses the main arguments of the\r\nreadings, the points found to be convincing, and those that are unconvincing, with reasons. Additional research is not required, but students should be very careful to stick to the topic and avoid\r\nunsubstantiated statements. The reflection will be submitted on Brightspace before the start of class, and presented in small groups each week. The schedule for reading reflections will be arranged in the first class. Official citations, bibliography and page numbers are not required unless you draw on work outside the assigned readings. You may not use extensive quotes in your reflections. You are\r\nexpected however to acknowledge the author to demonstrate you are engaging with their work (i.e. \u201cas Murphy argued, market power...\u201d). Include 2-4 probing discussion questions to stimulate\r\ndiscussion in class.\r\n\r\nWord Count Required: 750 words \r\n\r\nBibliography: APA\r\n",

    "description": "Stock market is characterized as dynamic, unpredictable and non-linear in nature. Predicting stock prices is a\r\nchallenging task as it depends on various factors including but not limited to political conditions, global economy,\r\ncompany\u2019s financial reports and performance etc. Thus, to maximize the profit and minimize the losses, techniques to\r\npredict values of the stock in advance by analyzing the trend over the last few years, could prove to be highly useful\r\nfor making stock market movements [1] [2]. Traditionally, two main approaches have been proposed for predicting\r\nthe stock price of an organization. Technical analysis method uses historical price of stocks like closing and opening\r\nprice, volume traded, adjacent close values etc. of the stock for predicting the future price of the stock. The second type\r\nof analysis is qualitative, which is performed on the basis of external factors like company profile, market situation,\r\npolitical and economic factors, textual information in the form of financial new articles, social media and even blogs by\r\neconomic analyst [3]. Now a days, advanced intelligent techniques based on either technical or fundamental analysis\r\nare used for predicting stock prices. Particularly, for stock market analysis, the data size is huge and also non-linear.\r\nTo deal with this variety of data efficient model is needed that can identify the hidden patterns and complex relations\r\nin this large data set. Machine learning techniques in this area have proved to improve efficiencies by 60-86 percent\r\nas compared to the past methods",

You will need to develop a Strategic Position Plan (SPP) for that product. To do this, you will need to apply the Ansoff Matrix and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix to this product by critically analysing the strategic actions the firm should take to allow that product to survive or to grow. The context is that you have been asked to evaluate the Strategic Plan of the firm and have been given the task of focussing, in the first instance, on the major product of the firm or any other select product (or service).\r\n \r\nSpecifically, you need to:\r\n \r\nIntroduce the firm\r\nIntroduce the product\r\nExplain and justify where the product currently \u201csits\u201d on the Ansoff matrix\r\nExplain and justify where the product currently \u201csits\u201d on the BCG matrix\r\nPresent a Strategic Position Plan (SPP) for the product that includes:\r\n- What the firm should do with that product in terms of geographical target markets (e.g. stay in-country, go overseas, etc.) to survive or to grow (only one) and justify your response\r\n- What the firm should do with that product in terms of pricing strategy to survive or to grow (only one) (e.g. cost leadership, differentiation, other)\r\n- A map of competitors in the chosen geographic market and price range, their strengths and setbacks, and how you will deal with them",

There is no one right or definitive answer to a case question. However, a student should not conclude that there are no wrong answers. Case responses differ because of differing identification of issues and analysis of relations among issues, differing determinations of what the root or underlying issues are, and differing development of recommendations to resolve the root issues and, in turn, the other issues. Although a variety of responses are valid at every stage, some, clearly, are incorrect. The case response format is not fixed; typically it depends on the case question. However, using a simple, standardized form will improve case responses and provide a context for unambiguous marking. It is recommended that students use the issue analyses-recommendations framework, deciding for themselves, according to the particular case, whether to use the three headings or to combine the first and second or the second and third. The three parts are described and analyzed below.\r\nIssues\r\nProblems or issues are those attributes, factors, and\/or activities that are wrong with the organization.\r\nStudents should read a case question once or twice to gather its essence. While reading, it is helpful to identify the issues by circling or highlighting them or by taking notes. Then, the student reviews these identified issues, adding to them any issues revealed by related analysis of financial statements and other supplementary information supplied.\r\nIn order to \"size up\" the root issues, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the organization and its issues. This analysis can be accomplished in two steps. First, make a list of the issues. Arrange and assemble similar issues into groups. Explain the relationships among the groups or categories that emerge at this stage. The groupings should be governed by two criteria.\r\nFirst, same or related issues should be grouped together; for example, all issues related to inaccurate financial information would go into one group. Second, associations among issues within a group should be specified; for example, inaccurate accounting information led to poor decisions on inventory orders.\r\nSecond, the relationship among the categories must be explained. This explanation should reveal the root issues. Once they are disclosed, the root issues should be linked in a logical sequence. This listing should show the dependent relationship between the other issues and their root issues. Care should be taken to account for any specific requests that arise because of the role assigned to the student. The request may specify the perspective the student takes in assessing the issues. Requests may also be understood as additional issues.\r\n\r\n The primary reason for grouping and ranking issues is to detect the underlying pattern of root issues. Sometimes, issues may also be the same as the root issues. In others, the detection may be more difficult. For example, consider a manufacturing firm with several problems: sales are not growing as expected; customers are returning products; customer satisfaction with the product quality is declining; and rework has increased. The root issue, lack of quality control, causes the other issues. Specifically, there was no quality control in the production process. The absence of quality control led to more rework and to the shipping of defective products, which the customers then returned or refused to buy again, and persuaded others not to buy.\r\nIt is identification of the root issues that enables the student to specify succinctly what is wrong with an organization. Proper identification requires close reading of the entire case, including appendices. Some information may have little or no bearing on the issues. As in the real-life situations that case analysis seeks to emulate, the student must sift carefully through all discernible aspects of a situation in order to determine what is relevant.\r\nAnalysis\r\nAnalysis and issue identification are highly related. Analysis requires a thorough assessment of why an issue arose or exists, how various issues relate to each other, and which issues lead to others and are, therefore, the most crucial to an under standing of the root issues. The analysis section includes required quantitative analysis, e.g., cost-volume-profit variance analysis. The analysis discloses how well essential organizational functions are working, e.g., planning, controlling, and management information systems. Analysis can also reveal, when necessary, the strengths and weaknesses of the organization. The analysis may vary in complexity. It can be as simple as listing the supporting issues, or as complex as finding the root or underlying issues.\r\nSome case questions have a singular answer either because of the context or because of the \"required\". Other case questions lend themselves to a series of alternatives for solving issues. Alternatives should be individually meaningful and mutually exclusive. For example, for a business with serious profit problems, one alternative might be to reduce costs and focus on the core business. Another alternative might be to close the business and sell the assets and inventories. Each alternative must be explained and justified as an answer, and if appropriate, its advantages and disadvantages should be discussed.\r\nRecommendations\r\nThe recommendations are a student's approach to remedying the root issues. If there are alternatives, the recommendations should be selected from the alternatives discussed in the analysis section. In resolving the root issues, the recommendations must also resolve most of the other issues. Recommendations should be action oriented, decisive and unambiguous; i.e., they should explicitly resolve the issues, assign responsibilities and set deadlines.\r\nIt may be suitable to include a conclusion that deals with implementation, especially with timing, and the assignment of responsibilities that arise out of the recommendations.\r\nFor example, with respect to the organization with profit problems, a student might recommend cost cutting and focus on the core business alternative. The student should follow the selection of this alternative by specifying how he or she would resolve the profit problems, and by suggesting an implementation plan. The implementation should detail which costs are to be cut, by whom, and with what consequences. It should detail which businesses are to be eliminated\r\n\r\n and which ones are to remain. If sufficient information is available, the recommendations should be quantified, showing the expected profit improvement.\r\nIn the report writing stage, it is often more time efficient and effective to identify, analyze, and make recommendations for each root issue individually. It is nevertheless essential to show the integration of the various issues within the case. Whatever the approach, it should be justified as the most appropriate for the case question.\r\nUse of Turnitin\r\nTo uphold academic integrity, Turnitin will be used in this assessment. By submitting your work through Turnitin, Turnitin's software will compare your work against a repository of internet and library resources in addition to the work of your peers and other academics to generate a similarity report. This similarity report verifies that your work is your own and that any referenced material is appropriately cited.\r\nSubmission\r\nStudents should save their excel file as one PDF file for the instructor to mark. Save this PDF document according to the naming convention: GroupNameAssignment.pdf. Include the names of all group members on the first page of the PDF. Then, one member of the group needs to submit your assessment on behalf of all group members electronically to the Turnitin submission inbox at the bottom (Part 1).\r\nClick the \"Part 2\" tab at the top of the Turnitin Assignment to submit your excel file to show the calculations.\r\nAll course work submitted will require students in the course to complete and submit the academic integrity checklist. Please download the academic integrity checklist on the Assessment page and have one group member upload it under \"Academic Integrity Checklist\" tab at the top.\r\nNOTE: Assignments will be considered incomplete if they do not include the required academic integrity checklist.\r\nIt is your responsibility to verify if the submission was successful. Be sure to keep a backup copy of all your assignments in the event that they are lost in transition.\r\n",

    "description": "Word Count: 1500 words \r\n\r\nTopic: Russia-Ukraine War\r\n\r\nAssignment Instructions:\r\nSelect a conflict case study and conduct a conflict assessment. Using research, identify the primary conflict drivers, key sources of insecurity, key stakeholders and their interests, and the interventions that have occurred or are occurring to keep and\/or build peace. Apply the concepts and literature discussed in Weeks 1-6 to discuss the relevance of the security-development nexus in the context of this case study. This is a critical summary and assessment of the dynamics underpinning a particular conflict case study. You should engage with the course material to help you understand your case and clearly articulate your assessment (which is also your argument) of the conflict. Your conflict assessment should include the following:\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Introduce the conflict case study you have selected, and summarize your assessment into a clear and concise argument (you can think of this like a thesis statement \u2013 it is a declarative articulation of the central argument being made in your conflict assessment) (e.g. \u2018While whole-of-government approaches have been attempted in in this context, interventions have failed to address one of the primary conflict drivers, thereby excluding a key stakeholder for peacebuilding). Answer the \u201cso what?\u201d of your assessment (e.g. The ongoing conflict in this context has led to mass migration, disruption of livelihoods, and has exacerbated the economic challenges this region faces. Failure to address this important conflict driver and include this key stakeholder in resolution efforts, risks this conflict becoming intractable).\r\n\r\nConflict Drivers: Identify and briefly explain the causes of conflict and the primary grievances that have led to violence in this context. Who are the key players? What are they disputing? Are external actors involved? Etc.\r\n\r\nSources of Insecurity: How is the conflict impacting civilians? What are the primary results of the violence? (e.g. economic precarity, displacement, sexual and gender based violence, genocide, political marginalization, etc.)\r\n\r\nKey Stakeholders and their Interests: In this section, detail who has interests in the conflict or who may be impacted by how the conflict plays out. This is not the warring parties (as these should be discussed in the Conflict Drivers section), but is rather about what other actors may impact or be impacted by how the conflict plays out in your case study context. These may include international actors, transnational forces, corporations, non-state groups, political parties,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nInterventions: Overview the types of peace-related interventions that have taken place in your case study. Have those interventions been successful or faced serious challenges? Have those interventions employed efforts at policy coherence by combining or harmonizing security and development? Based on your assessment of the conflict dynamics, what is missing from the interventions that have been tried or are being tried?",

    "description": "Today, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is growing. Here, automated chatbot systems powered by AI have the potential to affect people's behaviour via promoting education, promoting health, and other functions. To forecast intake, it is necessary to investigate the driving forces behind using health chatbots; nevertheless, very few research have examined their acceptance to date. This study aims to investigate participants' openness to interact with chatbots for health care powered by AI. India's expanding population, rising birth rate, and lowering death rates as a result of medical advancements have led to a decrease in the number of doctors available to serve the country's expanding population.\r\n\r\nTo deal with such cases there is a need for a smart chatbot and Intelligent that can give advice to doctors and sometimes even patients about what to do in such situations that ultimately lead to the saving lives of hundreds of people. A situation because sometimes doctors can make a mistake while looking for symptoms but a specially designed machine cannot make such a mistake. This AI-based medical discussion can make a decision based on the patient's request. In this case, it uses its own database and in some cases where something is not available in its database at the request of the user, it collects information from a search engine like Google and provides it to the user in Audio format as Google does.\r\n",

The chosen country is Germany and the time period of this study is 1980 to 2021. The Independent variable is GDP per capita and the dependent variable is health expenditure per capita.  As it is a time series data, a Basic stationary test of ADF is employed. It is followed by a bound cointegration to find if there is a long-term relationship between the two variables. The results were not statically significant, hence ARDL model is employed. Tests of robustness and stability are too performed.\r\n\r\nAs it is an independent project and my first time using Stata, I am struggling with interpretation as well as doubting the models if they are the right way to approach my research question. I wanted to test the causality too but as the ARDL model was statistically insignificant and there was no long-run relationship too as proven by the cointegration, I had my doubts about whether to extend the analysis further.",

(This can be downloads, XML files, JSON, HTML pages, data repositories, etc.) (10 points)\r\n\r\nYou must download and reformat the data to fit your database schema. (This involves using web scrapers, web API\u2019s, formatting scripts, parsing files, etc.) (10 points)\r\n\r\nYou must audit the quality and estimate the amount of data you\u2019ll gather.

Use at least THREE sources from the course\u2019s required or optional readings.\r\n2. Provide at least THREE peer-reviewed (journal) sources of your own.\r\nInclude an Introduction (that outlines the theoretical framework for understanding the topic) and use examples or a case study to present and analyze the topic. The Analysis section must reflect your own critical understanding of the problem, and not simply describe it or summarize the analysis of others. The Conclusion should relate the research to at least some of the broader themes of the course and explore implications for policy, activism, or future research.\r\nAPA is the preferred style for citations and references.",

    "description": "Normalization\r\n\r\nDatabase normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy.\r\n\r\nNormalization involves refactoring a table into smaller (and less redundant) tables but without losing information; defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.\r\n\r\nEdgar F. Codd, the inventor of the relational model (RM), introduced the concept of normalization and what we now know as the First normal form (1NF) in 1970. Codd went on to define the Second normal form (2NF) and Third normal form (3NF) in 1971.\r\n\r\nDesign Requirements\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou will check whether your tables are in First normal form (1NF), Second normal form (2NF) and Third normal form (3NF).  If not, you\u2019ll restructure your database so that all of the tables are in Third normal form; that is, you normalize the database.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour submission must include:\r\n\r\nA check that your tables are in First normal form (1NF)\r\nA check that your tables are in Second normal form (2NF)\r\nA check that your tables are in Third normal form (3NF)\r\nThe final SQL of a normalized database in Third normal form (3NF).\r\nViews for all of your use-cases\r\n \r\n\r\nFirst normal form (1NF)\r\n\r\nEach table has a primary key: minimal set of attributes which can uniquely identify a record\r\nThe values in each column of a table are atomic (No multi-value attributes allowed).\r\nThere are no repeating groups: two columns do not store similar information in the same table.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSecond normal form (2NF)\r\n\r\nAll requirements for 1st NF must be met.\r\nNo partial dependencies.\r\nNo calculated data\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThird normal form (3NF)\r\n\r\nAll requirements for 2nd NF must be met.\r\nEliminate fields that do not directly depend on the primary key; that is no transitive dependencies.\r\n \r\n\r\nCreate Views Syntax\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCREATE VIEW  Miley_Tweets AS\r\n\r\nSELECT Tweets.tweetid, Tweets.text, Users.screen_name \r\n\r\nFROM Tweets\r\n\r\nJOIN Users ON (Users.userid = Tweets.userid)\r\n\r\nWHERE Users.screen_name=  =\"MileyCyrus\";\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nScoring Rubric\r\n\r\n(25 points) Check that your tables are in First normal form (1NF)\r\n(25 points) Check that your tables are in Second normal form (2NF)\r\n(25 points) Check that your tables are in Third normal form (3NF) and the final SQL\r\n(25 points) Views for all of your use-cases",

    "description": "Individual Report\r\n3, 000 words worth 75% of module mark.\r\n\r\nDeadline: 3pm GMT, January 12th, 2023 online submission via Moodle link\r\n\r\nThere are two parts to the individual report:\r\n\r\nPart 1: Essay (70%) evaluating theoretical frameworks and concepts explaining the process of launching new ventures.  Your report should demonstrate wide reading and comprehension of the theoretical frameworks introduced in the module. You are expected to draw on key concepts and frameworks to analyse the process of launching new ventures. Good reports will draw on theoretical concepts to show understanding of the challenges typically encountered when creating a new venture. This may include frameworks explaining the influence of uncertainty and related knowledge problems on new ventures; strategies for creating new firms, the founders\u2019 role, and how entrepreneurs can overcome challenges such as resource dependency and liabilities of newness\/scale.\r\n\r\nPart 2: A Self-reflection (30%)  Written in the first person (I) this part of the report should demonstrate your personal understanding of the process of creating a new venture. You do not need to draw on theoretical frameworks in Part 2. Instead, you can draw on previous entrepreneurial experiences (e.g., founding your own firm, working for start-ups, entrepreneurial competitions (e.g., Ingenuity) internships, family business etc). It may also be helpful to draw on your experiences during this module. For example, what insights did you gain from designing a Business Model for a new venture? What might you do differently? Finally, you may project into the future to consider how you would approach the process of launching a new venture. Have you gained any insights from this module that you would use in the future if you were creating your own venture or joining a start-up?\r\n\r\nSome key points to consider:\r\n\r\n1)   The individual report requires two parts: Part 1 is a standard academic essay with references, introduction, discussion, and conclusion. Part 2 is a self-reflection written in the first person (I) and based on your personal understanding of the process of launching a new venture.\r\n\r\n2)   A marking rubric for the individual report is provided on Moodle.  Summarising from the rubric, a good report must demonstrate the following:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding of theoretical frameworks introduced during the module to explain the process of launching new ventures;\r\nA clear explanation of what business models are and why they are relevant for launching new ventures;\r\nEvidence of comprehension based on high quality and wide ranging referencing of literature included in the reading list;\r\nSelf-reflection showing personal understanding of the process of launching a new venture.\r\nWell structured, rigorous and logical report.\r\nWord count specified is to be strictly adhered to. A penalty will be applied if this is not adhered to.\r\n\r\nCoursework Submission Requirements:\r\n\r\nThe maximum word count (3, 000) is set by the module convenor and must be adhered to. The penalty for exceeding this limit is a five mark deduction.\r\n\r\nThe actual word count of the assignment must be stated by the student on the first page (cover sheet) of the assignment.\r\nThe overall word count does include citations and quotations.\r\nThe overall word count does not include the references at the end of the report.\r\nThe word count does not include figures and tables.\r\nAppendices may be included and are not included in the word count.\r\nStudents should prepare and submit their coursework assessments in the following format:\r\n\r\nFont:                       Verdana 12 point\r\nSpacing:                 1.5 spaced\r\nMargins:                 Normal (2.5 cm)\r\nReferencing:          Harvard citation style",

    "description": "Element 1 \u2013 Company Briefing Paper\r\nYou should choose one of the topics below as the subject of 2,000 words (maximum) fully-referenced Company Briefing Paper. Your chosen topic designates you as an \u201cExpert\u201d at the relevant Roundtable Experts & Novices workshop sessions (see Element 3 below).\r\nPlease note that a limited number of places will be available for each topic, therefore you should choose a secondary topic as a back-up. A topic sign-up list will be available on Canvas closer to the time.\r\n\u00b7 Brand placement\r\n\u00b7 Sponsorship\r\n\u00b7 Ethics in Marketing Communications\r\n\u00b7 Customer Journey Communications\r\n  \r\n\u00b7 Interactive\/Digital & mobile communications\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper must be written in the 3rd person and provide the Marketing Director of a fictitious company (see below for choice of companies) with the following:\r\n\u00a7 Anup-to-date,criticalreviewoftheacademicliteratureinyourchosentopic area\r\ndrawing on an absolute minimum of two carefully selected academic journal\r\narticles and on a range of at least ten diverse sources.\r\n\u00a7 Integrateintoyourdiscussionatleasttwoexamplesofhowtheacademic\r\ntheory reviewed is used\/ applied by brands\/ companies in current practice. Here, you should draw on practitioner sources such as the trade press (e.g. Marketing Week), newspaper articles (e.g. The Guardian) and news sources (e.g. BBC), and blogs, articles and websites written by credible industry commentators and experts.\r\n\u00a7 Recommendations for how the fictitious company should take the issues\r\nraised in your briefing paper into account in their future marketing\r\ncommunications.\r\nIn this way, your Company Briefing Paper will pull together the academic literature on a topic with examples drawn from marketing practice. Employers put a high value on candidates who can demonstrate skills in critical thinking, synthesising (bringing together) material from different sources, and analysing complex material.\r\nYou should choose any ONE of the fictitious companies shown below as the focal company for your Company Briefing Paper.\r\nCompany A: Get Fit Now is a new pay-as-you go gym, targeting consumers who have become disillusioned by high joining and membership fees of health clubs. As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place.\r\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience. The products are positioned as fun, stylish, \u201cmust-\r\n\r\nhave\u201d items aimed at encouraging young girls (12-17 years old) to get into a regular hair care routine.\r\nCompany C: Nice Ice is a chain of ice cream cafes targeted at teenagers and their parents. Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\r\nCompany D: Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable. It is targeted at consumers who need to replace their phone whilst reducing their impact on the environment. The company\u2019s marketing objective is to seize a 10% market share in the mobile phone market in year 1 by building awareness and trial rapidly.\r\nKey elements of a Company Briefing Paper\r\nPlease note that this is an indicative list only of what should be included in your work, it is nota running order or list of contents: thus, the logic and flow of material is up to you to decide.\r\n\u00a7 Introduction to the paper (what is the purpose of the paper and what it will cover?)\r\n\u00a7 Criticalanalysisanddiscussionofacademictheoryinyourchosentopicarea. You should aim to focus your discussion on any issue that you consider to be of relevance\/ importance\/ interest \u2013 but \u2013 be careful to scope it in. Do not be tempted to cover too many issues. Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another \u2013 thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth. For example, is there an area of controversy or divided opinion in the subject area, e.g. where researchers have found different or conflicting results?\r\n\u00a7 Examples\u2013integratepractitionersourcestodemonstratehowtheissues raised in your review of the academic literature are used \/applied in the case of at least two companies\/ organisations\/ brands in their marketing communications\r\n\u00a7 Conclusions and recommendations: what conclusion do you draw from the review of the academic literature? Based on this, what recommendations would you make to the Marketing Director of your chosen fictitious company?\r\n\u00a7 References: ALL sources used in the work must be shown in accurate Harvard style, including the in-text citations and the Reference list at the end of the work.\r\n   \r\n\u00a7 Appendices are optional and should be used only if there is a need to include any supporting information.\r\n\u00a7 Presentation style \u2013 your paper must be presented to professional standards and demonstrate a coherent structure. It should include a title page, contents page, page numbers, and a clear system of appropriate headings and sub- headings.\r\nElement 2 \u2013 Reflective statement on the research process\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper requires you to find, evaluate and use information drawn from a range of academic and practitioner sources. The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\r\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\r\n\u00a7 How did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\r\n\u00a7 What did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\r\n\u00a7 How might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\r\nThe reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as\r\na separate document.\r\n\r\nFor more read file attached below",

You are required to calculate a whole year solar radiation data, and check these for accuracy using data from any other sources. You may calculate solar radiation for one or more days for each month of the year, as you would like. The data must be presented appropriately, e.g., for sample days of each month, and monthly average or total values. Use appropriate values for ground reflectivity and clear sky index (from NASA website or any other sources). Explain the procedures that you have followed to calculate the solar radiation on a surface of an appropriate tilt angle to the horizontal that suits the location and give sample calculations for each step.",

A topic sign-up list will be available on Canvas closer to the time.\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Brand placement\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Sponsorship\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Ethics in Marketing Communications\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Customer Journey Communications\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Interactive\/Digital & mobile communications\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper must be written in the 3rd person and provide the Marketing Director of a fictitious company (see below for choice of companies) with the following:\r\n\r\nAn up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area\r\ndrawing on an absolute minimum of two carefully selected academic journal \r\narticles and on a range of at least ten diverse sources.  \r\nIntegrate into your discussion at least two examples of how the academic theory reviewed is used\/ applied by brands\/ companies in current practice. Here, you should draw on practitioner sources such as the trade press (e.g. Marketing Week), newspaper articles (e.g. The Guardian) and news sources (e.g. BBC), and blogs, articles and websites written by credible industry commentators and experts. \r\nRecommendations for how the fictitious company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their future marketing communications.\r\nIn this way, your Company Briefing Paper will pull together the academic literature on a topic with examples drawn from marketing practice. Employers put a high value on candidates who can demonstrate skills in critical thinking, synthesising (bringing together) material from different sources, and analysing complex material.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should choose any ONE of the fictitious companies shown below as the focal company for your Company Briefing Paper. \r\n\r\nCompany A: Get Fit Now is a new pay-as-you go gym, targeting consumers who have become disillusioned by high joining and membership fees of health clubs. As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place.  \r\n\r\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience. The products are positioned as fun, stylish, \u201cmust-have\u201d items aimed at encouraging young girls (12-17 years old) to get into a regular hair care routine.\r\n\r\nCompany C:  Nice Ice is a chain of ice cream cafes targeted at teenagers and their parents. Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\r\n\r\nCompany D:  Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable. It is targeted at consumers who need to replace their phone whilst reducing their impact on the environment. The company\u2019s marketing objective is to seize a 10% market share in the mobile phone market in year 1 by building awareness and trial rapidly.\r\n\r\nKey elements of a Company Briefing Paper\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is an indicative list only of what should be included in your work, it is not a running order or list of contents: thus, the logic and flow of material is up to you to decide.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to the paper (what is the purpose of the paper and what it will cover?)\r\nCritical analysis and discussion of academic theory in your chosen topic area. You should aim to focus your discussion on any issue that you consider to be of relevance\/ importance\/ interest \u2013 but \u2013 be careful to scope it in. Do not be tempted to cover too many issues.  Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another \u2013 thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth. For example, is there an area of controversy or divided opinion in the subject area, e.g. where researchers have found different or conflicting results?\r\nExamples \u2013 integrate practitioner sources to demonstrate how the issues raised in your review of the academic literature are used \/applied in the case of at least two companies\/ organisations\/ brands in their marketing communications\r\nConclusions and recommendations: what conclusion do you draw from the review of the academic literature?  Based on this, what recommendations would you make to the Marketing Director of your chosen fictitious company?\r\nReferences: ALL sources used in the work must be shown in accurate Harvard style, including the in-text citations and the Reference list at the end of the work.\r\nAppendices are optional and should be used only if there is a need to include any supporting information.\r\nPresentation style \u2013 your paper must be presented to professional standards and demonstrate a coherent structure.  It should include a title page, contents page, page numbers, and a clear system of appropriate headings and sub-headings.\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 2 \u2013 Reflective statement on the research process\r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper requires you to find, evaluate and use information drawn from a range of academic and practitioner sources. The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\r\n\r\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\r\n\r\nHow did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\r\nWhat did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\r\nHow might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\r\n The reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as a separate document.",

A topic sign-up list will be available on Canvas closer to the time.\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Brand placement\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Sponsorship\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Ethics in Marketing Communications\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Customer Journey Communications\r\n\r\n\u00b7       Interactive\/Digital & mobile communications\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper must be written in the 3rd person and provide the Marketing Director of a fictitious company (see below for choice of companies) with the following:\r\n\r\nAn up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area\r\ndrawing on an absolute minimum of two carefully selected academic journal \r\narticles and on a range of at least ten diverse sources.  \r\nIntegrate into your discussion at least two examples of how the academic theory reviewed is used\/ applied by brands\/ companies in current practice. Here, you should draw on practitioner sources such as the trade press (e.g. Marketing Week), newspaper articles (e.g. The Guardian) and news sources (e.g. BBC), and blogs, articles and websites written by credible industry commentators and experts. \r\nRecommendations for how the fictitious company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their future marketing communications.\r\nIn this way, your Company Briefing Paper will pull together the academic literature on a topic with examples drawn from marketing practice. Employers put a high value on candidates who can demonstrate skills in critical thinking, synthesising (bringing together) material from different sources, and analysing complex material.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should choose any ONE of the fictitious companies shown below as the focal company for your Company Briefing Paper. \r\n\r\nCompany A: Get Fit Now is a new pay-as-you go gym, targeting consumers who have become disillusioned by high joining and membership fees of health clubs. As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place.  \r\n\r\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience. The products are positioned as fun, stylish, \u201cmust-have\u201d items aimed at encouraging young girls (12-17 years old) to get into a regular hair care routine.\r\n\r\nCompany C:  Nice Ice is a chain of ice cream cafes targeted at teenagers and their parents. Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\r\n\r\nCompany D:  Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable. It is targeted at consumers who need to replace their phone whilst reducing their impact on the environment. The company\u2019s marketing objective is to seize a 10% market share in the mobile phone market in year 1 by building awareness and trial rapidly.\r\n\r\nKey elements of a Company Briefing Paper\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is an indicative list only of what should be included in your work, it is not a running order or list of contents: thus, the logic and flow of material is up to you to decide.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to the paper (what is the purpose of the paper and what it will cover?)\r\nCritical analysis and discussion of academic theory in your chosen topic area. You should aim to focus your discussion on any issue that you consider to be of relevance\/ importance\/ interest \u2013 but \u2013 be careful to scope it in. Do not be tempted to cover too many issues.  Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another \u2013 thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth. For example, is there an area of controversy or divided opinion in the subject area, e.g. where researchers have found different or conflicting results?\r\nExamples \u2013 integrate practitioner sources to demonstrate how the issues raised in your review of the academic literature are used \/applied in the case of at least two companies\/ organisations\/ brands in their marketing communications\r\nConclusions and recommendations: what conclusion do you draw from the review of the academic literature?  Based on this, what recommendations would you make to the Marketing Director of your chosen fictitious company?\r\nReferences: ALL sources used in the work must be shown in accurate Harvard style, including the in-text citations and the Reference list at the end of the work.\r\nAppendices are optional and should be used only if there is a need to include any supporting information.\r\nPresentation style \u2013 your paper must be presented to professional standards and demonstrate a coherent structure.  It should include a title page, contents page, page numbers, and a clear system of appropriate headings and sub-headings.\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 2 \u2013 Reflective statement on the research process\r\n\r\nThe Company Briefing Paper requires you to find, evaluate and use information drawn from a range of academic and practitioner sources. The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\r\n\r\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\r\n\r\nHow did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\r\nWhat did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\r\nHow might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\r\n The reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as a separate document.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nElement 3 \u2013Experts and Novices Roundtable Sessions\r\n\r\nFive Roundtable Experts & Novices sessions in Teaching Block 2 take the form of expert and student-led, co-created workshops, where students take on the role of either an \u201cExpert\u201d or a \u201cNovice\u201d and work together to share and develop knowledge about the topics for the Company Briefing Paper.\r\n\r\nFollowing from Element 1 above, your chosen literature review topic designates you as an \u201cExpert\u201d at the relevant roundtable session.  For the roundtable sessions where the topic is not your chosen literature review topic, you are a \u201cNovice\u201d.  Everyone will therefore be an \u201cExpert\u201d at one session and a \u201cNovice\u201d at the other four sessions.\r\n\r\nAttendance at the Roundtable Expert and Novices workshop sessions is mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshops is to develop subject knowledge and help you prepare for the assignment. You will also develop your research skills as well as gain confidence in your ability to explain the results of your research to others. Employers place high importance on communication and listening skills, and the Experts and Novices sessions will enable you to practice and hone your talents in both areas.  \r\n\r\nIn preparation for the workshops you are required to find and read at least four academic journal papers on your chosen literature review topic and prepare a written summary of your findings in the form of a Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). \r\n\r\nThe Critical Thinking module on Canvas provides resources to help you produce your TAG, and enrolment on the module is recommended:  https:\/\/canvas.kingston.ac.uk\/courses\/7439\r\n\r\nGiven the co-created nature of these sessions, their success depends entirely on everyone taking responsibility for their part in the sessions and the impact of this on others. This means actively participating in the workshops and coming prepared, i.e. having done the reading and produced the required TAG preparation paper. Specifically:\r\n\r\nExperts must find and read at least four academic journal articles* in their chosen topic area and prepare a written summary of these articles in the form of a fully-referenced Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). In your designated Expert workshop session, you will use your TAG paper as the basis for your explanation about your topic to a small group of Novices.\r\nExperts must also find examples of how brands\/companies have used\/ applied the theory in practice, to illustrate your findings to your Novices.\r\nNovices must read the relevant content in Fill & Turnbull (2019) or at least ONE academic journal article in order to gain a basic understanding of the topic AND find examples to discuss in class. Be ready to ask questions of your Expert.\r\nDuring the roundtable sessions, after the Experts have shared their findings with the Novices, Experts and Novices will work together to apply the theory to a practical scenario and produce recommendations for practice.\r\nAt the end of every roundtable both Experts and Novices are required to complete a Contribution Sheet that reflects on your input into the sessions and what you got out of them. You must submit a satisfactory Contribution Sheet in order to gain your marks for each workshop roundtable.\r\n \r\n",

    "description": "BUSM117 2023 Coursework assignment Instructions and guidance\r\nThe coursework assignment is worth 40% of the total mark for this module.\r\nSources\r\nFor both the coursework assignment and for the examination, you must ONLY use the literature listed in the reading lists in this module handbook for all conceptual and theoretical points.\r\nFor your case studies, however, you may use other peer-reviewed sources or other reputable, well-researched sources.\r\nDo not use practitioner web sites as sources for your assessments.\r\nWord limit\r\nMarks may be deducted if you overshoot the word limit. For the sake of clarity, unlike on some modules there is no percentage allowance for excess words: the limit is 2000 words exactly. (For the sake of clarity, unlike on some modules there is no percentage allowance for excess words: the limit is 2000 words exactly.)\r\nThis does not include reference lists and bibliographies although citations in the main body of your assignment do count. The words in the question itself, which will be your title, do not count against the word limit.\r\nDo not include a summary at the beginning of the essay, as well as your introduction: that would count against the word limit, and you would risk a deduction of marks for repetition.\r\nDo not use appendices: they would also count against the word limit and in any case the evidence supporting your argument should be in the main body of your essay.\r\nGuidance on the coursework assignments\r\n1. To answer any of the coursework questions, you will need to draw upon your learning from the seminars. You should expect to use examples which you examined in preparatory study for and in discussion during the seminars for this module.\r\n2. Use and compare two or three case studies to illustrate and support your arguments. You can draw cases from the articles and books suggested in the reading lists, in particular from the reading lists for the seminar tasks. Supplement the information on these cases by searching using the QMUL library, to find additional peer reviewed articles and also look for major investigative reports.\r\n3. Don\u2019t just describe. Focus your answer on causal processes which explain the outcomes for risk management which you want to argue in, in response to the specific question set.\r\n4. Ensure that your answer draws on material covered week 1-8 of the module.\r\nCoursework questions\r\nSelect one of the following three questions and write an essay of not more than 2000 words in answer to it.\r\n1. Enterprise risk management: Assess the evidence for and the limitations of the main arguments made by at least three advocates and by at least three critics of enterprise risk management (ERM). In particular, assess the evidence for their rival claims about its\r\n\r\npracticality in implementation, effectiveness and capacity to limit the effect of bias, for different kinds of businesses and organisations, for different kinds of risks, and for different phases of the business cycle.\r\nSupport your analysis of the strengths and weakness of the advocates\u2019 and the critics\u2019 cases by comparing either cases of attempts to implement ERM either in (a) two contrasting industries or (b) in two firms of very different sizes.\r\n2. Risk perception \/ communication: Under what conditions and with what risk communication strategies, if any, can companies succeed in reassuring consumers who are sceptical of the safety of a company\u2019s products or services and local residents living or working near a company\u2019s hazardous site or plant or operations?\r\nSupport your analysis by comparing evidence about conditions for success and strategies from two industries, one of which should be concerned with risk communication to consumers about product or service safety and the other with risk communication to local residents about operational safety. Both cases should concern routine business work, not crisis or post-crisis conditions. Identify key differences and similarities between these contexts.\r\n3. Project risk in mega-projects: Why does the implementation of project risk management procedures so often fail to reduce project risks in mega-projects? Review empirical evidence from research and assess the relative importance of at least four different factors.\r\nSupport your analysis by comparing cases of more and less successful mega-projects, where risk management procedures were implemented in each case, even in the less successful project.\r\nGeneral advice\r\n- Answer the exact question set.\r\n- Structure your essay carefully, with a clear introduction that \u2018signposts\u2019 the sequence of the argument to be made out, a main body of argument, and a conclusion which integrates the whole argument.\r\n- Support your answer with carefully marshalled, ordered and sequenced presentations of empirical evidence, setting out your reasons for answer to the question in full.\r\n- Use empirical cases and evidence to illustrate your argument.\r\n- Use the literature in the field critically.\r\n- Define and explain key concepts when you introduce them.\r\nCommon mistakes to avoid\r\n1. Being vague \u2013 e.g., failing to define key terms, writing obscurely, failing to be clear and unambiguous.\r\n2. Over-claiming \u2013 claiming too much, claiming more than your evidence really supports.\r\n3. Asserting rather than arguing \u2013 failing to support your claims with empirical evidence\r\nand logically related reasons.\r\n4. Swithering \u2013 arguing for one answer to the question set in one part of the essay and\r\nthen arguing for a quite different or even opposite answer in another part of the essay.\r\n5. Being indecisive \u2013 writing a \u2018on the one hand ... and on the other ...\u2019 answer to the\r\nquestion set that does not come down clearly in favour of one answer to it.\r\n6. Not considering the limitations of at least one opposing case, if only briefly.\r\n\r\n7. Presenting a conclusion that does not follow from the argument or the evidence.\r\n8. Trying to rely on knowledge drawn from other modules.\r\n9. Writing without a well-thought out structure \u2013 e.g., no evident and logical sequence of\r\npoints that build up to a step-by-step argument to a conclusion.\r\n10. Being uncritical and not being thoughtful \u2013 e.g., taking the conventional \u2018textbook\u2019\r\nwisdom for granted, without interrogating it, without examining whether the evidence\r\nsupports it.\r\n11. Summarising \u2013 just summarising what leading authors have written, without making an\r\nargument of your own.\r\n12. Writing about the topic rather than answering the exact question set.\r\n13. Being too simple \u2013 e.g., assuming practice will mechanically follow rules set in laws or\r\nobjectives of programmes, taking simple abstract and theoretical differences between\r\nindustries for granted, over-generalising about fields.\r\n14. Presenting your essay poorly \u2013 e.g., writing illegibly, not making your paragraph breaks clear and\r\nobvious, not numbering and indenting key points in those cases where this would be helpful to the reader in understanding some steps in your argument.\r\nFormat\r\n\u25aa All work must be typed and submitted in MS Word or Adobe PDF format\r\n\u25aa Font size should be 12 point (unless otherwise specified)\r\n\u25aa Font style should be Arial\r\n\u25aa Lines should be double-spaced\r\n\u25aa Leave margins for comment Insert page numbers\r\n\u25aa Use a header containing your student ID number, the module code to which your work\r\napplies, and the date\r\n\u25aa Always spell-check and proof read your work before handing it in (once you have\r\nsubmitted your work you will not be permitted to retrieve it)\r\n\u25aa Keep your own electronic back-up copy of your work and if possible save on two\r\ndevices\r\n\u25aa Avoid plagiarism\r\n\u25aa Submit your work on time\r\nLate submissions\r\n1. Coursework submitted late (and there are no extenuating circumstances) will incur a late penalty. Five per cent of the total marks available shall be deducted for every period of 24 hours, or part thereof, that an assignment is overdue there shall be a deduction of five per cent of the total marks available (i.e. five marks for an assessment marked out of 100). After seven calendar days (168 hours or more late) the mark shall be reduced to zero, and recorded as 0FL (zero, fail, late).\r\n2. Each module has word limits for coursework assignments; however, the decision about whether to impose a penalty mark for exceeding the word limit is made by each module organiser. You must check the module handbook and the assignment briefing documents to see whether the particular module organiser has adopted a penalty system. It is your responsibility to read the handbook and assignment briefing carefully. If no penalty is specified then the module organiser will take into account the word length under the standard marking conventions. For example, if you have exceeded the word limit then it might be that you have not been sufficiently succinct or focused in your assignment and therefore might be penalised for these weaknesses. Please note that word limits do NOT\r\n\r\n3. 4.\r\n5.\r\n6. 7.\r\n8.\r\ninclude references or appendices. However if excessive material is included on appendices then this too will be judged accordingly and you may be awarded a lower mark.\r\nYou should ensure that your submission is in either Microsoft Word or PDF format. Failure to submit in either one of these formats will result in a mark of 0 being awarded for the particular assessment. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the file format is correct and it can be opened by the receiving party.\r\nYou should ensure that the correct piece of assignment is uploaded as the document downloaded on the due date by the module organiser will be marked regardless of content. You will not have another opportunity to submit the work again if you mistakenly uploaded the wrong document.\r\nALLOW YOURSELF PLENTY OF TIME TO SUBMIT YOUR COURSEWORK. DO NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE\r\nComputer problems, such as computer viruses, failure to make a back-up copy or temporary internet access problems, will NOT be viewed as a valid reason for late submission.\r\nCheck that your assignment submission has been successful, and print a copy of the confirmation screen.\r\nIf you\r\nvia QMplus however you will be penalised for late submission, the only exception to this is if you have an approved extension due to extenuating circumstances.\r\nsubmit your assignment after the deadline, you will still be able to submit your coursework\r\nSubmission deadline\r\nDate\r\nTime\r\nQMplus Link\/Page\r\nEstimated 29th March 2023\r\nEstimated 1600pm\r\nTbc \u2013 Assessment information tab in BUSM117 QMPlus page\r\n\r\n                Marking criteria for both the coursework assignment and the examination\r\nThe marking criteria for the coursework assignment and for the examination are the same. They are set out in the following table, which you will also see used to provide feedback on your assignment and to explain the mark given. For both the coursework assignment and for the examination, you must ONLY use the literature listed in the reading lists in this module handbook for all conceptual and theoretical points. For your case studies, however, you may use other peer-reviewed sources or other reputable, well-researched sources. Do not use practitioner web sites as sources for your assessments.\r\nMarking criteria by grade\r\nband\r\nEvidence of learning from\r\nlectures, seminars, module\r\nmaterials and guidance

You will write up an up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area, as well as some recommendations to a fictitious company (to be chosen from a list of four) on how this company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their \\r\\nfuture marketing communications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe individual assignment comprises of three elements:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. A fully-referenced Company Briefing Paper (2,000 words maximum)\\r\\n\\r\\n2. A reflective statement on the research process (200 words maximum)\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Preparation for and contribution to five \u201cExperts and Novices\u201d roundtables, including a TAG (Thematic Analysis Grid). \\r\\n\\r\\n The task\\r\\n\\r\\nElement 1 \u2013 Company Briefing Paper\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should choose one of the topics below as the subject of 2,000 words (maximum) fully-referenced Company Briefing Paper. Your chosen topic designates you as an \u201cExpert\u201d at the relevant Roundtable Experts & Novices workshop sessions (see Element 3 below).\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that a limited number of places will be available for each topic, therefore you should choose a secondary topic as a back-up. A topic sign-up list will be available on Canvas closer to the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u00b7 Brand placement\\r\\n\\r\\n\u00b7 Sponsorship\\r\\n\\r\\n\u00b7 Ethics in Marketing Communications\\r\\n\\r\\n\u00b7 Customer Journey Communications\\r\\n\\r\\n\u00b7 Interactive\/Digital & mobile communications\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Company Briefing Paper must be written in the 3rd person and provide the Marketing Director of a fictitious company (see below for choice of companies) with the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn up-to-date, critical review of the academic literature in your chosen topic area\\r\\ndrawing on an absolute minimum of two carefully selected academic journal \\r\\narticles and on a range of at least ten diverse sources. \\r\\nIntegrate into your discussion at least two examples of how the academic theory reviewed is used\/ applied by brands\/ companies in current practice. Here, you should draw on practitioner sources such as the trade press (e.g. Marketing Week), newspaper articles (e.g. The Guardian) and news sources (e.g. BBC), and blogs, articles and websites written by credible industry commentators and experts. \\r\\nRecommendations for how the fictitious company should take the issues raised in your briefing paper into account in their future marketing communications.\\r\\nIn this way, your Company Briefing Paper will pull together the academic literature on a topic with examples drawn from marketing practice. Employers put a high value on candidates who can demonstrate skills in critical thinking, synthesising (bringing together) material from different sources, and analysing complex material.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nYou should choose any ONE of the fictitious companies shown below as the focal company for your Company Briefing Paper. \\r\\n\\r\\nCompany A: Get Fit Now is a new pay-as-you go gym, targeting consumers who have become disillusioned by high joining and membership fees of health clubs. As a newcomer they need to build awareness very quickly and ensure that potential customers understand their position in the market place. \\r\\n\\r\\nCompany B: Bio-gloss is a brand of shampoo and hair care products targeted at a young teenage female audience. The products are positioned as fun, stylish, \u201cmust-have\u201d items aimed at encouraging young girls (12-17 years old) to get into a regular hair care routine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompany C: Nice Ice is a chain of ice cream cafes targeted at teenagers and their parents. Positioned as a trendy place to hang out with friends, the chain plans to open 25 outlets in large towns within a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompany D: Green-Phone is a new brand of smart phone positioned as sustainable. It is targeted at consumers who need to replace their phone whilst reducing their impact on the environment. The company\u2019s marketing objective is to seize a 10% market share in the mobile phone market in year 1 by building awareness and trial rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nKey elements of a Company Briefing Paper\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that this is an indicative list only of what should be included in your work, it is not a running order or list of contents: thus, the logic and flow of material is up to you to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroduction to the paper (what is the purpose of the paper and what it will cover?)\\r\\nCritical analysis and discussion of academic theory in your chosen topic area. You should aim to focus your discussion on any issue that you consider to be of relevance\/ importance\/ interest \u2013 but \u2013 be careful to scope it in. Do not be tempted to cover too many issues. Remember, your aim is to offer a critical discussion, not to simply describe one article after another \u2013 thus, you should aim to go for depth rather than breadth. For example, is there an area of controversy or divided opinion in the subject area, e.g. where researchers have found different or conflicting results?\\r\\nExamples \u2013 integrate practitioner sources to demonstrate how the issues raised in your review of the academic literature are used \/applied in the case of at least two companies\/ organisations\/ brands in their marketing communications\\r\\nConclusions and recommendations: what conclusion do you draw from the review of the academic literature? Based on this, what recommendations would you make to the Marketing Director of your chosen fictitious company?\\r\\nReferences: ALL sources used in the work must be shown in accurate Harvard style, including the in-text citations and the Reference list at the end of the work.\\r\\nAppendices are optional and should be used only if there is a need to include any supporting information.\\r\\nPresentation style \u2013 your paper must be presented to professional standards and demonstrate a coherent structure. It should include a title page, contents page, page numbers, and a clear system of appropriate headings and sub-headings.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nElement 2 \u2013 Reflective statement on the research process\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Company Briefing Paper requires you to find, evaluate and use information drawn from a range of academic and practitioner sources. The ability to carry out information search and demonstrate reflective professional practice are important skills that employers are looking for.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the reflective statement, therefore, you should write 200 words reflecting on your research process and the trustworthiness of the sources you have used. You should address:\\r\\n\\r\\nHow did you judge whether your sources were credible and reliable?\\r\\nWhat did you learn from the research process in undertaking this assignment?\\r\\nHow might you take this learning forward into your professional life?\\r\\n The reflective statement should be inserted in a separate section at the very end of your Company Briefing Paper, after the references and any appendices, and NOT as a separate document.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nElement 3 \u2013Experts and Novices Roundtable Sessions\\r\\n\\r\\nFive Roundtable Experts & Novices sessions in Teaching Block 2 take the form of expert and student-led, co-created workshops, where students take on the role of either an \u201cExpert\u201d or a \u201cNovice\u201d and work together to share and develop knowledge about the topics for the Company Briefing Paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing from Element 1 above, your chosen literature review topic designates you as an \u201cExpert\u201d at the relevant roundtable session. For the roundtable sessions where the topic is not your chosen literature review topic, you are a \u201cNovice\u201d. Everyone will therefore be an \u201cExpert\u201d at one session and a \u201cNovice\u201d at the other four sessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttendance at the Roundtable Expert and Novices workshop sessions is mandatory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purpose of the workshops is to develop subject knowledge and help you prepare for the assignment. You will also develop your research skills as well as gain confidence in your ability to explain the results of your research to others. Employers place high importance on communication and listening skills, and the Experts and Novices sessions will enable you to practice and hone your talents in both areas. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn preparation for the workshops you are required to find and read at least four academic journal papers on your chosen literature review topic and prepare a written summary of your findings in the form of a Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Critical Thinking module on Canvas provides resources to help you produce your TAG, and enrolment on the module is recommended: https:\/\/canvas.kingston.ac.uk\/courses\/7439\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the co-created nature of these sessions, their success depends entirely on everyone taking responsibility for their part in the sessions and the impact of this on others. This means actively participating in the workshops and coming prepared, i.e. having done the reading and produced the required TAG preparation paper. Specifically:\\r\\n\\r\\nExperts must find and read at least four academic journal articles* in their chosen topic area and prepare a written summary of these articles in the form of a fully-referenced Thematic Analysis Grid (TAG). In your designated Expert workshop session, you will use your TAG paper as the basis for your explanation about your topic to a small group of Novices.\\r\\nExperts must also find examples of how brands\/companies have used\/ applied the theory in practice, to illustrate your findings to your Novices.\\r\\nNovices must read the relevant content in Fill & Turnbull (2019) or at least ONE academic journal article in order to gain a basic understanding of the topic AND find examples to discuss in class. Be ready to ask questions of your Expert.\\r\\nDuring the roundtable sessions, after the Experts have shared their findings with the Novices, Experts and Novices will work together to apply the theory to a practical scenario and produce recommendations for practice.\\r\\nAt the end of every roundtable both Experts and Novices are required to complete a Contribution Sheet that reflects on your input into the sessions and what you got out of them. You must submit a satisfactory Contribution Sheet in order to gain your marks for each workshop roundtable.\\r\\n \\r\\n",

The essay should consist of an Introduction (including the thesis statement), main body of the essay (no limit to the number of paragraphs you could write), and a conclusion. The research paper must demonstrate research and follow the Thesis-Evidence-Evaluation model.\r\nThe secondary sources are meant to either support your argument or to be used as a counterargument. In any case, it is better to use them as enabling evidence. Your own voice must not be drowned out by the secondary sources, that is, your paper should not become a mere repetition and summing up of the claims in the secondary sources. You may either quote directly some lines from the secondary sources or sum up their ideas.\r\nWhether you quote directly or sum up the main ideas in secondary sources, you must cite them in your essay. Otherwise, it will be an act of plagiarism, which will invite severe reprimand in the form of failing or deducting marks.\r\nThe essay must follow either MLA or Chicago style guide for both in-text citations and Works Cited\/Reference guidelines.  \r\nCredits will be given for originality and creativity.",

The winner is the highest bidder.\r\nBlind Auction: A type of sealed bid auction where the bids are private and the winner is the highest bidder.\r\nVickrey Auction: A type of sealed bid auction where the bids are private. The winner is the highest bidder but the price paid is the second-highest bid.\r\nAverage Price Auction: A type of sealed bid auction where the bids are private. The winner is the highest bidder but the price paid is the average of all bids.\r\nThe auctions are conducted through smart contracts written in Solidity and Metamask is used for client-side communication.\r\n\r\nActually, I have completed the smart contracts and web application but the transactions through MetaMask are not working this is one of the issues(the integration part to be precise).\r\nAnd currently, the project is for random stuff and I want to make it specific for the auction of paintings for that I need to upload and preview painting images on the web app.\r\nThe compiler version is 0.6.12\r\n\r\nTo start app follow commands :\r\n1) in a new terminal type \r\n      a) truffle develop\r\n      b) migrate --reset\r\n2) in a new terminal \r\n      a) cd client \r\n      b) npm install\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0c)\u00a0npm\u00a0start",

    "description": "So, they are asking you to look at Royce Lingerie, a family-\r\nowned British business, which is one of the organisations that recently approached OBBC.\r\nRoyce Lingerie is specialised in manufacturing wire-free bras that provide comfort and support \r\nfor all women \u2013 whether they are buying for their teenage daughter, are pregnant or nursing, \r\nare looking for larger cup sizes, or have undergone breast or chest surgery. Royce is also \r\ncommitted to supporting the LGBTQ+ community by manufacturing bras, for example, for \r\npeople who identify as transgender.\r\nThey never want to stand still because their markets are permanently evolving and changing. \r\nThey always aim to be ahead of the competition and know what the \u2018big picture\u2019 changes and \r\nthe important \u2018zeitgeist\u2019 trends are.\r\nTherefore, OBBC is pitching now to help Royce Lingerie prepare for a future brand positioning\r\nthat takes latest broader societal trends as well as a comprehensive market analysis into \r\naccount. Due to time constraints, OBBC decides for the initial pitch phase to focus\r\ngeographically on the UK market only. For more details, see www.royce-lingerie.co.uk\r\nOne of the key challenges is to attract new and younger target audiences without losing older \r\nloyal customers.\r\nYour report needs to cover the following elements\r\n\r\n ANALYSIS: What is this brand about? What are the key meanings, manifestations \r\nand stakeholders of the brand? What does the \u2018product\u2019 portfolio currently look like? \r\nWhat are the brand\u2019s current vision, mission and core values? What are the \r\nstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats? How is the brand currently \r\npositioned? Your analysis is expected to look at a variety of elements of the brand. \r\nThis should include the brand\u2019s IDEOLOGY, CAPABILITIES, \r\nCONSUMERS\/STAKEHOLDERS, COMPETITION and ENVIRONMENT. \r\nMark allocation: 30%\r\n \r\nSTRATEGY: Based on your analysis, you are expected to discuss two different \r\npotential future positioning options for the brand which could be established in the UK \r\nmarket in autumn\/winter 2023. You then need to justify\/evaluate which of the \r\ndiscussed positionings has the most potential, i.e. you need to choose one \r\npositioning option and justify your decision. You can extend a positioning strategy \r\nthat already exists, but you need to justify why this is the best option. Finally, you are \r\nexpected to make suggestions as to how the brand positioning idea could be \r\ntransformed into strategic frameworks that can be used to brief the client\u2019s marketing \r\nteam who need to bring this positioning idea to life. In this context you must apply \r\none or more of the following frameworks: (a) SBM Vision, Mission & Values; (b) SBM \r\nBrand Pyramid; and\/or (c) Transformation Grid. \r\nMark allocation: 30%\r\n\r\n IMPLEMENTATION: Based on your strategic framework(s), you need to develop \r\nand explain implementation activities to show how, for example, the client\u2019s UK \r\nmarketing team could implement the core strategic idea which you have developed\r\nwith different specific stakeholders. This needs to contain an activity in terms of co-\r\ncreative new product development. One implementation activity needs to utilise \r\nsocial media-based communications or other latest digital technology. \r\nMark allocation: 30%\r\nThe remaining 10% are allocated for the quality of the presentation of the assignment. This \r\nmeans, for example, overall presentation style; standard of English; breadth, depth, and \r\nquality of sources; references list presented in Harvard Referencing Style; word count well \r\nused.\r\nYou are required to produce a report comprising the three key areas outlined above. You \r\nmust support your decisions with academic references as well as other secondary sources. \r\nTherefore, you must search for and use relevant information on the brand, but you are NOT \r\nexpected to conduct primary empirical research as part of the assignment.\r\n\r\nMust not contact the client at all.\r\nThe information shared here needs to be 100% confidential or I'll get in big trouble as this is an actual client not a fictional one just for the assignment.",

    "description": "\u25cf\tYou must prepare and submit an original business report addressing the tasks identified later in this section, but summarised below.\r\n\u25cf\tYour report must analyse and evaluate the operations management of an organisation, or of a specific business unit\/division, and draw conclusions over the extent to which its operational capability supports its corporate strategy and provides competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nThe Organisation:\r\nYou must select one focal organisation as the subject of your assignment. Where the organisation has different divisions or a disparate product\/service offer, you may have to select one specific area of the organisation for study (i.e., you will need to define the scope to be covered in your report). You may also find it appropriate to select by geographical region, or if the organisation has disparate operations, one of these.\r\n \r\nThe organisation selected should meet the following criteria:\r\n\u25cf\tIt should be a well-known business \u2013 you will find more data\/information on large well-known businesses;\r\n\u25cf\tIt must have a website that is available in English and produce annual reports in English;\r\n\u25cf\tIt is recommended that your selected company be publicly listed\/publicly traded on the stock market \u2013 you will find more data\/information available on such organisations.\r\n\r\nThe Content of the Assignment:\r\nYou are required to demonstrate your learning from the course material by analysing and evaluating the operations management of your chosen organisation (or business unit\/division) in a report containing the following sections.\r\n \r\n1.\tA brief introduction to the organisation, including an overview of the environment in which it operates and the pressures that its sector faces. This will give the reader sufficient context to make sense of the report.\r\n \r\n2.\tAn analysis of the operations of the selected organisation \u2013 you must apply the transformation process model and the 4Vs model (and consider the implications) to your selected organization and their operations. In addition to this you should select two further topics\/concepts covered in the module or from your wider reading (relating to operations management) this might be (as appropriate to the organisation) \u2013 performance objectives and current performance, the types of operating process, the service concept (what the operations systems are designed to deliver), location and layout, capacity management, the scheduling and control of resources, supply chain management, quality assurance or the application of TQM principles, the application of \u2018lean\u2019 principles.\r\n\r\nThis section is likely to represent the largest part of the Report and it is for you to decide which concepts\/theories\/models you include in this section.\r\n \r\n3.\tThe identification of the major strengths and weaknesses of the operation \u2013 achieved performance against required performance. From your analysis, you should also consider the extent to which the operations functions support the broader business strategy of the organisation, and the extent to which the organisation\u2019s operations capability is used to create competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nPresenting coursework for assessment:\r\nYour assignment when submitted should not include your name \u2013 we use a system of anonymous marking to reduce the risk of any unconscious bias. \r\n\r\nThe authentic and essential requirements for this piece of assessed work are:\r\n\u25cf\tThe report must contain a reference list. All sources cited must be referenced in the report. The Harvard referencing system must be used. \r\n\u25cf\tYou must use at least 10 academic sources other than the set texts (and ideally substantially more). In addition to academic sources, you\u2019re expected to utilise \u2018other\u2019 sources to provide information, data and insights into your selected organisation and its operations.\r\n\u25cf\tThe assignment must be structured and presented as a formal business report.\r\n\u25cf\tArial font size 12 is recommended for the main body\/text.\r\n\r\nThe report length should not exceed 2,500 words.\r\n",

    "description": "You are required to complete a 3,000 word research proposal to demonstrate your ability to identify, analyse a research problem related to business and management, and to set out a plan for a research project to investigate that problem. The aim of this assessment is to enable you to develop and demonstrate your ability to: (a) diagnose a problem in business and management, (b) formulate research questions, determine how to answer these questions by drawing on the academic literature, identify and assess the potential of appropriate research methods and (e) plan a small-scale research project.\r\nThis report is among the most challenging assignments set during your M.Sc. programme. You should note that it is quite different from, and more challenging than, writing a conventional coursework essay-style paper. You are being asked to anticipate the issues that you will have to overcome in planning, conducting and reporting a small research project. The best research proposals are usually those produced by those students who have devoted considerable thought to the assignment before even beginning to write the proposal. It is not an assignment that can be left to the last minute.\r\nYour choice of problem for the project proposal report does not commit you to that topic for your dissertation. You can just complete the report as a free-standing exercise in which you are assessed on your competences as indicated in your ability to analyse a problem, grasp the arguments and the evidence contained in the literature, devise a suitable research design and present it effectively. You are free to select a different topic for your dissertation if you so wish, although there are obvious advantages in sticking to a topic to which you have already given thought and invested some work. However, you must avoid cutting-and-pasting parts of the proposal into the dissertation. In other words, your assignment for this module and your dissertations should be different, otherwise your report might be flagged as self- plagiarism.",

This brand extension is aimed at leveraging Miele's reputation for quality and innovation to offer consumers a complete home solution. The company's new furniture collection includes sofas, armchairs, and tables that are designed to complement Miele's existing product range and meet the needs of discerning customers who value both form and function. With this move, Miele is diversifying its revenue streams and positioning itself as a lifestyle brand that offers a holistic approach to home living.\r\nMiele considering entering the furniture business as a brand extension. This move is expected to help the company diversify its product portfolio and generate additional revenue streams. \r\n\r\nWe will need to discuss the size of the furniture market, its growth potential, key trends, competitors, and PESTEL analysis to evaluate the feasibility of Miele's decision. And explain how expanding into this new sector will make sense for the brand. (we need to choose a specific market for this expansion such as UK. USA etc. choose any country for which you can find the most relevant data)\r\n\r\nI'll add a previous student's assignment they got really good marks and we need to use that format and create a similar looking high quality assignment. Using images, table, data from reputable sources is very important. As well as citing them like in the sample assignment.\r\n\r\nthe things we need to write: \r\nCover page (not included in word count) - This needs to include title, student number and assignment word count NOT your name as it is marked anonymously.\r\n2)\tTable of Contents (not included in word count) \r\n3)\tExecutive summary (not included in word count) 1-2 paragraphs. \r\n4)\tIntroduction (state the aim of the assignment and its structure, provide an overview of the chosen organisation\/product) (approx. 200 words). This needs to include why the brand stretch into the new category makes sense for that brand and identify any ethical\/responsible marketing issues.\r\n5)\tEnvironmental analysis supporting the opportunity for the product development (external + internal using suitable models) (approx. 500 words)\r\n6)\tSegmentation, Targeting, Positioning Strategy (approx. 350 words)\r\n7)\tMarketing Plan (product, price, place, promotion) using the models from the course (approx. 700 words).\r\n8)\tConclusion: Implications for responsible marketing (approx. 200 words) \r\n9)\tReferences (not included in word count)",

    "title": "How consumers cope with the challenge of identity loss or change due to life transitions such as retirement, divorce, or migration and how this influences their consumption of nostalgic products and experiences in the future. ",
    "description": "You can use the social-self theory to explore how consumers seek to maintain or restore their sense of belonging and identity through consumption.\r\n\r\nUsing self-identity theory, identify and evaluate a contemporary societal challenge that is influencing the consumption behaviour of consumers. Develop conclusions from your evaluation. Use these conclusions to develop a \u2018future imagination\u2019 of how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\r\nYour evaluation must include a critical appraisal of self-identity theory to inform your arguments. Additionally you must include evidence of relevant changing consumption behaviours and predictions from relevant experts. You must develop your \u2018future imagination\u2019 from your conclusions. \r\nIn addressing the above question, you are advised to make the following choices:\r\n1)\tChoose a specific consumer segment who engage in a specific consumption behaviour occurring in response to a societal challenge. You can phrase this as a problem or opportunity. \r\n2)\tFocus on one consumer segment pertinent to your topic and country\/sector choice. You should develop a profile of this segment, providing as much pertinent information as you can, e.g. using sociodemographics, psychographics. Please present visually or in table format, fully referenced.\r\n3)\tFocus on one country for your essay. Having this focus will make it a lot easier for you to identify and evaluate the evidence within the word limit specified.\r\n4)\tWhile you are required to use self-identity theory for your essay, you MUST focus on a specific concept, model or framework within it. For example, the self-concept model, social-self, pro-environmental self-identity, pro-social self-identity, body image, etc. Choose ONE of these. Do NOT include multiple identity frameworks\/ models in your essay because this will undermine the depth of analysis you can achieve within the 3000 word count limit.\r\nOnce you make the above choices, you are required to investigate research evidence from academic articles, news from legitimate sources, industry reports etc. to critically analyse how consumer behaviour has changed in response to the societal issue you have identified. Building from this appraisal, you will explain, evaluate and apply your identity framework\/model to your chosen issue. This will enable you to develop evidence-based analytical conclusions, from which you can create your future imagination.\r\n\r\nYou should draw on a good range of high quality academic and expert opinion sources to construct solid arguments for your paper. You should use relevant examples and data to support your claims. Ensure you fully reference all sources of information.\r\nYou are required to write a critique of transforming\/transformed consumer behaviour, informed by contextual information, evidence and relevant theory. Your critique will involve you assessing varied data, ideas and scholarship from varied sources. Be adventurous in your searching but note the advice given to you on reputable sources. \r\nYou must focus on one framework\/model of identity theory in your essay. This will really help you to develop a stronger critical appraisal to show your understanding and critical thinking. \r\nYou must choose only one country and one consumer segment. Within this country and segment, try to analyse your chosen CB transformation broadly and briefly. Then narrow down again to your chosen sector\/industry\/segment and again articulate this transformation. You now have an explanation that is country, sector and consumer specific. Now that you have this foundation, you can begin to build your academic arguments by integrating your chosen identity theory. Continuously, apply and evaluate your theory to your country\/sector\/segment otherwise your context and theory risk being disconnected. Lastly, extrapolate your conclusions to a 5-10 year future in order to imagine how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. \r\nYou must ensure the evidence you use to compile your paper relates to your choices (i.e. do not use American evidence to discuss China!). Preliminary reading will help you to make your choices. Whatever you choose to do, ensure you present your argument for your choices at the start of your paper \u2013 and justify them. \r\nAssemble the evidence for your arguments, avoid unsubstantiated statements and bias - this is an objective investigation. It is essential that you critique your chosen theory and evidence, do not just describe it; evaluate the contribution it makes to our understanding of transforming\/transformed consumer behaviour and how marketing to consumers (as customers or event participants) will evolve as a result in the future.\r\n\r\nGUIDELINES:\r\nPart 1: Introduction and Explanation (500-800 words): Introduce and examine your societal challenge, consumer segment and behaviour and country. Explain the issue clearly and its impact, citing supporting evidence and justify why it is worthy of exploration in your essay. Include a profile of your chosen consumer segment.\r\nPart 2: Evaluation and application of theoretical framework (1500-1800 words): Begin by giving an overview of identity theory, then focus on your chosen identity framework\/model. Explain it and apply it to you challenge and context in part 1. Evaluate its contribution in explaining the CB transformation that is occurring, using scholarly research and evidence to support your arguments. Use examples throughout, pertinent to your focus. Images and illustrations can be used and add value to written arguments. \r\nPart 3: Conclusions (300-500 words): Develop conclusions based on your content in parts 1 and 2. Do not simply summarise your essay (this is not a conclusion). Your conclusions should be insightful and analytical and lead into your future appraisal. They should also demonstrate your learning from critically reviewing your chosen context and identity theory. Developing a \u2018visual map\u2019 to illustrate this can be a useful communication tool; this is entirely up to you. Examples are discussed in the assignment briefings and clinics. Keep your writing style concise and focused. Numbering each conclusion will be helpful for cross referencing with your future appraisal. You could also consider these as a map for part 4.\r\nPart 4: The future (<500 words): This is where you get to be creative! Tell us, based on your analysis in part 1,2 and 3 your core ideas for imagining how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. Include specific examples of your chosen issue\/segment\/behaviour. You can present your \u2018future imagination\u2019 as text and visually (we are not expecting artwork from you). Visualisation is encouraged and can include multiple formats, e.g. drawing, photographs, and digital images. Infographics are useful, using free software that is readily available. Check permissions for using any images that are not your own (and reference them as instructed by the owners).   \r\nMake sure your discussion of the future is connected and builds upon what you have stated in the body of your essay and is backed by evidence.\r\nPlease note: \r\nParts 1 and 2 need to be fully and extensively referenced. \r\nPart 3 will contain some pertinent references to support your insight e.g. from futurism, but should not repeat the full range of references in your theory review. Remember conclusions represent your critical thinking built from your prior analysis which you have already referenced. \r\nPart 4 does not require references, albeit you may need to reference some futurism insights if you include them here instead of in your conclusion (either place is fine). This section is showcasing your critical and creative thinking.\r\nThe use of subheadings to break up the essay is OK, however, please ensure you don\u2019t have too many as you risk hyper-fragmenting your essay, which may hamper the flow of discussion and subsequent analysis.\r\n",

Use a carefully selected case study to illustrate your answer and reflect on your own development as a current or future public and\/or third sector leader.\r\n\r\n2) Is \u2018distributed leadership\u2019 the most appropriate model of leadership for the contemporary public and\/or third sector(s)? Use a carefully selected case study to illustrate your answer and reflect on your own development as a current or future public and\/or third sector leader.\r\n\r\n3) To what extent are private sector-derived models of strategic and performance management appropriate for public sector and\/or third sector leaders? Use a carefully selected case study to illustrate your answer and reflect on your own development as a current or future public and\/or third sector leader.\r\n\r\nCase studies are factual and verifiable accounts of events (like \u2018stories\u2019). They do not provide us with definitive generalisable answers to questions, but provide rich, contextual insights. Case studies thereby help us to bring analytical arguments to life, and to avoid overly formulaic and theoretical responses to questions. [The classic text on using case studies in management is Robert K. Yin. (2014). Case Study Research Design and Methods (5th ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.]\r\n\r\nFor this essay, cases should illustrate leadership in action during a specified period of change or reform in a particular organisational or sector (maybe in any country) and contain sufficient detail for you to convincingly describe a particular type of leadership practice and its outcomes for the organisation.\r\n\r\nYou can source your case studies from any verifiable and authoritative source, so long as they meet these conditions above. The sources may be online reports or articles, for example from leadership\/public administration\/voluntary sector journals, from government\/NGO publications or sector-practitioner publications (see Module Outline for suggestions).",

    "description": "Assessment instructions\r\nYour task is to write an essay that addresses the following question in 3000 words:\r\nUsing self-identity theory, identify and evaluate a contemporary societal challenge that is influencing the consumption behaviour of consumers. Develop conclusions from your evaluation. Use these conclusions to develop a \u2018future imagination\u2019 of how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\r\nYour evaluation must include a critical appraisal of self-identity theory to inform your arguments. Additionally you must include evidence of relevant changing consumption behaviours and predictions from relevant experts. You must develop your \u2018future imagination\u2019 from your conclusions.\r\nIn addressing the above question, you are advised to make the following choices:\r\n1) Choose a specific consumer segment who engage in a specific consumption behaviour occurring in response to a societal challenge. You can phrase this as a problem or opportunity. Here are some suggestions to help you to develop your own ideas. You do not need to choose from any of them. You can chose any combination that addresses the assignment question. Please ask your tutor if you are unsure:\r\n\uf02d Climate change and sustainable development, e.g. eco-tourists and climate change, millennials and consumption reduction, activists and anti-consumption.\r\n Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\n\uf02d The increasing interest in health and fitness is another potential area, including shifts that have occurred from the Covid-19 pandemic. Examples include a shift from in-person to online fitness classes. Growth in wearable health technology. Increasing membership of online health and wellbeing platforms.\r\n\uf02d Advances and benefits of artificial intelligence in consumption choices. Examples include using an AI chatbot for a health care consultation. AI in agriculture (intelligent farming) to increase food availability\/nutrition to mitigate food poverty and migration. AI designed to inform consumer\u2019s decision-making (e.g. online shopping \u2013 getting purchasing right first time to prevent waste). Developing positive body image chatbots to promote a healthy body image among younger consumers.\r\n\uf02d Shifts in dietary choices. For example, in response to food\/water insecurity, biodiversity, and animal welfare considerations, as well as advances in food science and technology. This has supported shifts to \u2018different lifestyles\u2019 and created opportunities for food innovation development and lifestyles including vegan, flexitarian, anti-meat, artificial food e.g. lab-made \u2018meat\u2019.\r\n\uf02d Economic constraints are also triggering CB changes, e.g. frugal consumption connected with growing poverty, consuming from \u2018foodbanks\u2019 and \u2018community fridges\u2019. Sharing\/leasing not buying, pre- owned\/recycled\/ repurposed are also an outcome of this, as well for ecological reasons (positive or negative depending on perspectives).\r\n2) Focusononeconsumersegmentpertinenttoyourtopicandcountry\/sector choice. You should develop a profile of this segment, providing as much pertinent information as you can, e.g. using sociodemographics, psychographics. Please present visually or in table format, fully referenced.\r\n3) Focus on one country for your essay. Having this focus will make it a lot easier for you to identify and evaluate the evidence within the word limit specified.\r\n4) Whileyouarerequiredtouseself-identitytheoryforyouressay,youMUST focus on a specific concept, model or framework within it. For example, the self-concept model, social-self, pro-environmental self-identity, pro-social self- identity, body image, etc. Choose ONE of these. Do NOT include multiple identity frameworks\/ models in your essay because this will undermine the depth of analysis you can achieve within the 3000 word count limit.\r\nOnce you make the above choices, you are required to investigate research evidence from academic articles, news from legitimate sources, industry reports etc. to critically analyse how consumer behaviour has changed in response to the societal issue you have identified. Building from this appraisal, you will explain,\r\n18\r\n Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\n\r\nevaluate and apply your identity framework\/model to your chosen issue. This will enable you to develop evidence-based analytical conclusions, from which you can create your future imagination.\r\nGuidelines\r\nYou should draw on a good range of high quality academic and expert opinion sources to construct solid arguments for your paper. You should use relevant examples and data to support your claims. Ensure you fully reference all sources of information.\r\nYou are required to write a critique of transforming\/transformed consumer behaviour, informed by contextual information, evidence and relevant theory. Your critique will involve you assessing varied data, ideas and scholarship from varied sources. Be adventurous in your searching but note the advice given to you on reputable sources.\r\nYou must focus on one framework\/model of identity theory in your essay. This will really help you to develop a stronger critical appraisal to show your understanding and critical thinking.\r\nYou must choose only one country and one consumer segment. Within this country and segment, try to analyse your chosen CB transformation broadly and briefly. Then narrow down again to your chosen sector\/industry\/segment and again articulate this transformation. You now have an explanation that is country, sector and consumer specific. Now that you have this foundation, you can begin to build your academic arguments by integrating your chosen identity theory. Continuously, apply and evaluate your theory to your country\/sector\/segment otherwise your context and theory risk being disconnected. Lastly, extrapolate your conclusions to a 5-10 year future in order to imagine how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them.\r\nYou must ensure the evidence you use to compile your paper relates to your choices (i.e. do not use American evidence to discuss China!). Preliminary reading will help you to make your choices. Whatever you choose to do, ensure you present your argument for your choices at the start of your paper \u2013 and justify them.\r\nAssemble the evidence for your arguments, avoid unsubstantiated statements and bias - this is an objective investigation. It is essential that you critique your chosen theory and evidence, do not just describe it; evaluate the contribution it makes to our understanding of transforming\/transformed consumer behaviour and how marketing\r\n19\r\n Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\n\r\nto consumers (as customers or event participants) will evolve as a result in the future.\r\nNot sure what to choose? Maybe this article will help: Rust, Roland T. (2020). The future of Marketing, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 37(1), 15-26.\r\nTo help develop your ideas and your \u2018future imagination\u2019, refer to the academic articles published in \u201cFutures\u201d in the suggested readings at the end of this assignment briefing. This is a starting point, please source others relevant to your chosen topic.\r\nTo see an example of an imaginative future go to Dermody, J., Koenig-Lewis, N., Zhao, A. L., & Hanmer-Lloyd, S. (2021). Critiquing a Utopian Idea of Sustainable Consumption: A Post-Capitalism Perspective. Journal of Macromarketing, 41(4), 626\u2013645. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/0276146720979148\r\nFurther readings will be added to Moodle, as appropriate. Please also refer to the readings attached to each topic, as these may also be relevant for your essay.\r\nPresenting coursework for assessment\r\nYour assignment when submitted should not include your name \u2013 we use a system of anonymous marking to reduce the risk of any unconscious bias. For some authentic assessments, there may be an exception to this, so please confirm with your Module Leader.\r\nWe suggest the following format for your essay, which mimics the marking criteria listed in the table below, Please discuss with your seminar leader if you wish to depart from this structure:\r\nPart 1: Introduction and Explanation (500-800 words): Introduce and examine your societal challenge, consumer segment and behaviour and country. Explain the issue clearly and its impact, citing supporting evidence and justify why it is worthy of exploration in your essay. Include a profile of your chosen consumer segment.\r\nPart 2: Evaluation and application of theoretical framework (1500-1800 words): Begin by giving an overview of identity theory, then focus on your chosen identity framework\/model. Explain it and apply it to you challenge and context in part 1. Evaluate its contribution in explaining the CB transformation that is occurring, using scholarly research and evidence to support your arguments. Use examples throughout, pertinent to your focus. Images and illustrations can be used and add value to written arguments.\r\n20\r\n  Postgraduate Module Handbook 2022-23\r\n\r\nPart 3: Conclusions (300-500 words): Develop conclusions based on your content in parts 1 and 2. Do not simply summarise your essay (this is not a conclusion). Your conclusions should be insightful and analytical and lead into your future appraisal. They should also demonstrate your learning from critically reviewing your chosen context and identity theory. Developing a \u2018visual map\u2019 to illustrate this can be a useful communication tool; this is entirely up to you. Examples are discussed in the assignment briefings and clinics. Keep your writing style concise and focused. Numbering each conclusion will be helpful for cross referencing with your future appraisal. You could also consider these as a map for part 4.\r\nPart 4: The future (<500 words): This is where you get to be creative! Tell us, based on your analysis in part 1,2 and 3 your core ideas for imagining how consumers and their behaviour will evolve in the future in response to this challenge, and how marketing will need to adapt to continue to engage with them. Include specific examples of your chosen issue\/segment\/behaviour. You can present your \u2018future imagination\u2019 as text and visually (we are not expecting artwork from you). Visualisation is encouraged and can include multiple formats, e.g. drawing, photographs, and digital images. Infographics are useful, using free software that is readily available. Check permissions for using any images that are not your own (and reference them as instructed by the owners).\r\nMake sure your discussion of the future is connected and builds upon what you have stated in the body of your essay and is backed by evidence.\r\nPlease note:\r\nParts 1 and 2 need to be fully and extensively referenced.\r\nPart 3 will contain some pertinent references to support your insight e.g. from futurism, but should not repeat the full range of references in your theory review. Remember conclusions represent your critical thinking built from your prior analysis which you have already referenced.\r\nPart 4 does not require references, albeit you may need to reference some futurism insights if you include them here instead of in your conclusion (either place is fine). This section is showcasing your critical and creative thinking.\r\nThe use of subheadings to break up the essay is OK, however, please ensure you don\u2019t have too many as you risk hyper-fragmenting your essay, which may hamper the flow of discussion and subsequent analysis.\r\n\r\nmy topic- over dependence on technology in the USA on GenZ",

Thus, highlighting the \u2018shining point\u2019 (i.e., unique selling point) that differentiate your services from other competitors is very important, which will largely influence the quality of your whole report. \r\n\r\n2.\tBe realistic, remember that you also need to propose the launch schedule.\r\n\r\n3.\tBe consistent, from the motivation of the new services (why you want to invest in your project) to targeting the right segments (you think they will buy your services) to the marketing strategies (how can you realize your project), you should talk about\/sell one \u2018story\u2019.\r\n\r\n4.\tWith the word limit of 2,000, it is difficult and dangerous to list many points of your (small) practices, especially those could be shared with many other services\/ your competitors. In other words, when you talk about the common practices (which you think is very important for your service), you could briefly mention and discuss, or could even summarize it and put it into appendix (show that you learned what was covered in the module). What you should focus and elaborate are those points that you think could show the \u2018new\u2019, \u2018difference\u2019 and \u2018innovative\u2019 of your services (show your creativity and innovation ability). \r\n\r\n5.\tAs we have discussed the Ps (process, people, and physical evidence, and promotion) which are relevant to services, I recommend you to focus on the contents covered in the module. But if you think some classical Ps (e.g., product, price, place) are very important\/special\/innovative in your services, you could discuss them, but please justify them. \r\n\r\n6.\tRemember when you list any practice, it is better give some support (e.g., theory, statistics as reference) to justify yourself. Avoid listing any implementation without any justification or reference support. \r\n\r\n7.\tRemember to propose a \u2019name\u2019 to your services",

The aim of this assessment is to enable you to develop and demonstrate your ability to: (a) diagnose a problem in business and management, (b) arrive at the consequent research questions, (c) determine how to answer these questions by drawing on the academic literature, (d) assess the potential of different research methods and (e) plan a small-scale research project.  \r\nYour report is intended to form the plan for how you might use the literature (by drawing on the ideas and findings of others), design a research project and analyse the findings.  \r\nThis report is among the most challenging assignments set during the M.Sc. programmes. You are being asked to anticipate the issues that will confront you in conducting a small research project. Thus, it is quite different from and more difficult than, writing a conventional coursework paper. The best reports are usually those produced by those students who have devoted considerable thought to the assignment before even beginning to write the report.  \r\nYour choice of problem for the project proposal report does not commit you to that topic for your dissertation. You can just complete the report as a free-standing exercise in which you are assessed on your ability to analyse a problem, grasp the arguments and the evidence contained in the literature and devise a suitable research design. You are free to select a different topic for your dissertation if you so wish, although there are obvious advantages in sticking to a topic to which you have already given thought and invested some work (although you must avoid cutting and-pasting parts of the proposal into the dissertation).  \r\n\r\n \r\n        The Research Proposal requirements\r\n        The report must include the following main elements: \r\n1.\tTitle. This can include a subtitle and should indicate what the research is essentially about. \r\n2.\tAbstract. The abstract sums up the research problem\/questions, research design and methods, and relation to the literature and\/or practice. \r\n3.\tIntroduction in the form of an analysis of the problem to be addressed. This introductory material should include a clear statement of the problem, the question(s) to be researched, the importance of those questions and an indication of the potential role of business and management theories in answering the questions. The introduction should have clear labelling of the aim and objectives. \r\n4.\tA summary critical review of the relevant literature, both theoretical and applied. This section should indicate what can be learnt from the current literature and will seek to identify some of the strengths and weaknesses of that literature. You are not expected to provide a comprehensive guide to the literature, but you are expected to communicate an understanding of some of the main theoretical ideas and presently available evidence relating to your topic. You must refer to the academic literature and not just to the professional literature (note that the former usually involves seeking an in-depth and critical understanding of problems while the latter is usually restricted to matters of 'how-to-do-it'). \r\n5.\tAn outline of the proposed research design and methods. You should outline the research design and the likely methods, taking care to point to the strengths and weaknesses of your proposed research methods. You must outline a research project that can feasibly be done within the constraints of the M.Sc. dissertation process, indicate that you have good reason to believe that the necessary data is available and can be collected, that your choice of method(s) is appropriate and likely to produce reliable and valid results, and that you have considered any ethical questions raised by the research. \r\n6.\tConclusion. The conclusion summarizes the problem, the purposes of the study, the research question\/s, and the methodology. It should also acknowledge any possible limitations of the approach \r\n(e.g. any problems of generalizability from limited number of cases). \r\n7.\tDocumentation: Appendix, references, and general presentation of the work. Using the Harvard approach to referencing and the references are done correctly in alphabetic order. You may include an appendix for any additional material you consider relevant, however the appendix will not be assessed. Diagrams and tables should be numbered, captioned, and presented correctly. \r\n\r\nTo pass the assignment, you must include all these key elements. However, you do not have to devote an equal number of words to each of them. In particular, the analysis of the problem is very likely to be shorter than the other elements. \r\nWhat you should NOT do (these reflect the failings of past research proposals)\r\n\u2022\tDo not write an essay about a general topic.  \r\n\u2022\tDo not just describe the application of a particular management technique or method (e.g. TQM, a project management technique), you must analyse the underlying problem and critically evaluate the alternative 'solutions'. \r\n\u2022\tDo not write a literature review that is solely or largely dependent on pop management books or the professional rather than the academic literature. \r\n\u2022\tDo not write a literature review in the form of an annotated bibliography. \r\n\u2022\tDo not write a general essay on research methods. Instead critically evaluate those methods you are likely to use. \r\n\u2022\tDo not include lots of incidental, trivial detail about how you would actually carry out the research.  \r\nWhat makes for a good research proposal  \r\nThere are many ways to write a project proposal report, and we have no particular model answer in mind. The following are some of the points we are looking for: \r\n\u2022\tYou must have a problem which you can analyse, define and for which you can devise feasible research questions. \r\n\u2022\tYou should explain the main issues in your chosen topic and their wider academic and practical relevance. \r\n\u2022\tWhen reviewing the literature, you should communicate an awareness of the quality of the evidence on which an author draws and of the methodological issues posed by the way in which that evidence has been gathered. \r\n\u2022\tYou should give a sense of how the literature has developed and identify the main themes of schools of thought in the literature. How do later articles and contributions in books build on the earlier results findings, and ideas in the literature? \r\n\u2022\tMost importantly, you should be critical and evaluative.  Do not just describe the literature you survey, explain why the authors have arrived at the conclusions they have. State whether you consider the authors have achieved their aims. Explain any weaknesses you feel there are in specific articles or books and, if possible, how those weaknesses could have been overcome. It is better to evaluate critically fewer references rather than cite many references with little critical appraisal. \r\n\u2022\tYou should indicate the wider significance of your study \u2013 what are the wider implications of what you have found both for the academic literature (whose approaches\/viewpoints\/hypotheses do your findings support?) and for practice (e.g. should people in organizations do things differently as a result?). \r\n\u2022\tObserve the usual requirements for a good presentation \u2013 be grammatical, use punctuation marks correctly, try to avoid jargon etc. You should use headings and sub-headings to organise your material. \r\n \r\nFormal Requirements\r\nThe report should be no more than 3000 words in length (excluding the bibliography), with a 10% upper limit and should be organised as indicated above. \r\n The report should be double-spaced, well presented and structured. Appendices should only be used when judged to be strictly necessary to understand the project. The work should use the Harvard system of references, and all references should be included in a properly presented bibliography.  \r\n",

    "description": "2.\tInstructions and guidance\r\n           The aim of the proposal\r\nThe research proposal requires you to demonstrate your ability to identify, analyse a research problem related to business and management, and to set out a plan for a research project to investigate that problem. The aim of this assessment is to enable you to develop and demonstrate your ability to: (a) diagnose a problem in business and management, (b) arrive at the consequent research questions, (c) determine how to answer these questions by drawing on the academic literature, (d) assess the potential of different research methods and (e) plan a small-scale research project.  \r\nYour report is intended to form the plan for how you might use the literature (by drawing on the ideas and findings of others), design a research project and analyse the findings.  \r\nThis report is among the most challenging assignments set during the M.Sc. programmes. You are being asked to anticipate the issues that will confront you in conducting a small research project. Thus, it is quite different from and more difficult than, writing a conventional coursework paper. The best reports are usually those produced by those students who have devoted considerable thought to the assignment before even beginning to write the report.  \r\nYour choice of problem for the project proposal report does not commit you to that topic for your dissertation. You can just complete the report as a free-standing exercise in which you are assessed on your ability to analyse a problem, grasp the arguments and the evidence contained in the literature and devise a suitable research design. You are free to select a different topic for your dissertation if you so wish, although there are obvious advantages in sticking to a topic to which you have already given thought and invested some work (although you must avoid cutting and-pasting parts of the proposal into the dissertation).  \r\n\r\n \r\n        The Research Proposal requirements\r\n        The report must include the following main elements: \r\n1.\tTitle. This can include a subtitle and should indicate what the research is essentially about. \r\n2.\tAbstract. The abstract sums up the research problem\/questions, research design and methods, and relation to the literature and\/or practice. \r\n3.\tIntroduction in the form of an analysis of the problem to be addressed. This introductory material should include a clear statement of the problem, the question(s) to be researched, the importance of those questions and an indication of the potential role of business and management theories in answering the questions. The introduction should have clear labelling of the aim and objectives. \r\n4.\tA summary critical review of the relevant literature, both theoretical and applied. This section should indicate what can be learnt from the current literature and will seek to identify some of the strengths and weaknesses of that literature. You are not expected to provide a comprehensive guide to the literature, but you are expected to communicate an understanding of some of the main theoretical ideas and presently available evidence relating to your topic. You must refer to the academic literature and not just to the professional literature (note that the former usually involves seeking an in-depth and critical understanding of problems while the latter is usually restricted to matters of 'how-to-do-it'). \r\n5.\tAn outline of the proposed research design and methods. You should outline the research design and the likely methods, taking care to point to the strengths and weaknesses of your proposed research methods. You must outline a research project that can feasibly be done within the constraints of the M.Sc. dissertation process, indicate that you have good reason to believe that the necessary data is available and can be collected, that your choice of method(s) is appropriate and likely to produce reliable and valid results, and that you have considered any ethical questions raised by the research. \r\n6.\tConclusion. The conclusion summarizes the problem, the purposes of the study, the research question\/s, and the methodology. It should also acknowledge any possible limitations of the approach \r\n(e.g. any problems of generalizability from limited number of cases). \r\n7.\tDocumentation: Appendix, references, and general presentation of the work. Using the Harvard approach to referencing and the references are done correctly in alphabetic order. You may include an appendix for any additional material you consider relevant, however the appendix will not be assessed. Diagrams and tables should be numbered, captioned, and presented correctly. \r\n\r\nTo pass the assignment, you must include all these key elements. However, you do not have to devote an equal number of words to each of them. In particular, the analysis of the problem is very likely to be shorter than the other elements. \r\nWhat you should NOT do (these reflect the failings of past research proposals)\r\n\u2022\tDo not write an essay about a general topic.  \r\n\u2022\tDo not just describe the application of a particular management technique or method (e.g. TQM, a project management technique), you must analyse the underlying problem and critically evaluate the alternative 'solutions'. \r\n\u2022\tDo not write a literature review that is solely or largely dependent on pop management books or the professional rather than the academic literature. \r\n\u2022\tDo not write a literature review in the form of an annotated bibliography. \r\n\u2022\tDo not write a general essay on research methods. Instead critically evaluate those methods you are likely to use. \r\n\u2022\tDo not include lots of incidental, trivial detail about how you would actually carry out the research.  \r\nFormal Requirements\r\nThe report should be no more than 3000 words in length (excluding the bibliography), with a 10% upper limit and should be organised as indicated above. \r\n The report should be double-spaced, well presented and structured. Appendices should only be used when judged to be strictly necessary to understand the project. The work should use the Harvard system of references, and all references should be included in a properly presented bibliography.  \r\nSUBMISSION FORMAT:\r\nPlease observe the following style guide. \r\n\u2022 All work must be typed and submitted in MS Word or Adobe PDF format \r\n\u2022 Font size should be 12 point (unless otherwise specified) \r\n\u2022 Font style should be Arial \r\n\u2022 Lines should be double-spaced \r\n\u2022 Leave margins for comment \r\nInsert page numbers \r\n\u2022 Use a header containing your student ID number, the module code to which your work applies, and \r\nthe date. And Please:\r\n\u2022 Always spell-check and proof read your work before handing it in (once you have submitted your \r\nwork you will not be permitted to retrieve it) \r\n\u2022\tKeep your own electronic back-up copy of your work and if possible save on two devices \r\n\u2022\tAvoid plagiarism \r\n\u2022\tSubmit your work on time\r\n\r\n \r\n",

    "description": "Assessment Brief \u2013 Dissertation\r\nYou need to write an individual research proposal (100%). You are expected to develop a suitable and realistic research proposal, with a view to\r\nundertaking a focused piece of contemporary research with clear and tangible outcomes of interest and relevance to the work context. The\r\ntopic that you choose to study for your research is your own choice but should relate to business and management disciplines, and in particular\r\nto your specific Master programme subject. For example, if you're studying the MSc International Business & Marketing Management, your\r\ndissertation should focus on a marketing topic, such as digital marketing, media and advertising, brand management, etc. You will need to\r\ndecide on the area of research for your Research Proposal fairly quickly \u2013 in just a few weeks.\r\nIdeally, your Research Proposal should be something novel that will have practical value to businesses or other organisations. It should have a\r\ntheoretical perspective as well as a practical purpose. One idea is to take a favourite management area (e.g., marketing) and an area of\r\npersonal interest (e.g., SMEs in the hospitality sector) and then develop a project into e.g., the marketing of SMEs in the hospitality sector.\r\nAlternatively, look for something topical in the news that has a business perspective. Some students use the project to develop their knowledge\r\nof an area within which they hope to develop a career. The lectures, seminars and your reading will help you to decide on your topic and the\r\nbest research approach to use. However, if you are really struggling, we are available to give advice.\r\nResearch Proposal Structure\r\nThe following information is a general overview of the structure and contents of a Research Proposal and additionally summarises what should\r\nbe demonstrated by the proposal and by you as a researcher. This is not a definitive structure, only a guideline that covers all the important\r\nareas in a logical manner. There is flexibility to adjust or change this structure depending on your individual needs. The following elements may\r\nform subheadings for your research proposal document. The numbers in brackets are a guide of how many words are required for each section.\r\nHowever, they are only a guide and not definitive.\r\nWorking title (maximum 12 words)\r\nThis should capture the essence of your project, and includes information which relates to the proposed study which you wish to undertake.\r\nIntroduction (approximately 300 words)\r\n\u25cf What are you exploring and why?\r\n\u25cf Put the research into context.\r\n\u25cf Why is it important to study this topic (rationale)?\r\n1\r\n\u25cf Clearly identify your research question\/problem.\r\n\u25cf What are the specific aims and objectives of the research?\r\nLiterature review (approximately 700 words)\r\nThis section should identify and critically review the key literature that has been written on your topic. It should compare and contrast\r\nperspectives that have been gleaned from reading and investigating the subject. While this might come from textbooks, journal articles and\r\nother reports, journal articles will be your main source. The review might also include more practitioner-based studies which are of\r\nsignificance. Remember, it is important to look for themes in the literature, not just describe one article after another. Make sure you reference\r\neverything clearly and be careful not to plagiarise. Also, make sure you clearly show the importance of the literature you are writing about to\r\nyour topic. DO NOT just put slabs of unrelated literature in your literature review. Please show the reader why it is in there. What does it mean\r\nto your project?\r\nMethodology (approximately 900 words)\r\nProvide a clear and justified statement of your proposed research approach to address your research question\/aim. You should provide a clear\r\nrationale for your choice of method(s), with a clear link to your research question\/aim. You should also include a critical evaluation of the\r\nstrengths and limitations of your proposed approach.

Abstract. The abstract sums up the research problem\/questions, research design and methods, and relation to the literature and\/or practice.\r\n3. Introduction in the form of an analysis of the problem to be addressed. This introductory material should include a clear statement of the problem, the question(s) to be researched, the importance of those questions and an indication of the potential role of business and management theories in answering the questions. The introduction should have clear labelling of the aim and objectives.\r\n4. A summary critical review of the relevant literature, both theoretical and applied. This section should indicate what can be learnt from the current literature and will seek to identify some of the strengths and weaknesses of that literature. You are not expected to provide a comprehensive guide to the literature, but you are expected to communicate an understanding of some of the main theoretical ideas and presently available evidence relating to your topic. You must refer to the academic literature and not just to the professional literature (note that the former usually involves seeking an in-depth and critical understanding of problems while the latter is usually restricted to matters of 'how-to-do-it').\r\n5. An outline of the proposed research design and methods. You should outline the research design and the likely methods, taking care to point to the strengths and weaknesses of your proposed research methods. You must outline a research project that can feasibly be done within the constraints of the M.Sc. dissertation process, indicate that you have good reason to believe that the necessary data is available and can be collected, that your choice of method(s) is appropriate and likely to produce reliable and valid results, and that you have considered any ethical questions raised by the research.\r\n6. Conclusion. The conclusion summarizes the problem, the purposes of the study, the research question\/s, and the methodology. It should also acknowledge any possible limitations of the approach\r\n(e.g. any problems of generalizability from limited number of cases).\r\n7. Documentation: Appendix, references, and general presentation of the work. Using the Harvard approach to referencing and the references are done correctly in alphabetic order. You may include an appendix for any additional material you consider relevant, however the appendix will not be assessed. Diagrams and tables should be numbered, captioned, and presented correctly.\r\n ",
